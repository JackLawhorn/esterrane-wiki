Lucent Key is a small, low-lying strip of land situated around Esterrane's Northeastern rim. Once home to a clan of Esterranean Tritons, there exist a number of temple ruins that have since breached the surface of the waves under which they once were situated. Due to its proximity to Warwood, the key has more recently been resettled by the newly returned Waris Imperial Navy as a prison camp.

## Ambient Mood

Little more than a large sandbar, the size of this miniature island varies greatly between high- and low-tide. As a result much of the perimeter of the key is guarded by a near impenetrable wall of thick mangrove forests, just one factor making both escapes from within and prison breaks from without more difficult. The biggest breach of this barrier is a newly constructed dock which acts as the only entrance/exit for newly arrived prisoners and naval officers alike, though the shallowness of the surrounding waters means rowboats must be taken to larger craft anchored some distance off-shore. The features of Lucent Key include the following:

- Play up the near inescapability of the island. The wall of mangroves, impermanence of the tides, and single guarded dock make escaping the cells and evading the guards the least of your worries.
- The shallowness of the surrounding waters and density of mangrove forests mean that the beaches are home to many schools of colorful and exotic fish. This will sometimes attract a flock of wild Sirens looking for a quick meal, which leads to the always comical scenario of Naval Officers needing to shoo them away.
- Due to the sometimes dangerously strong tides, the only landmass that is close enough to feasibly swim to is Warwood itself. Legend has it, however, that Pirate Lord Simir the Inscrutable once swam all the way from the key to Thieves' Hole.

## Settlements

The prison camp structures takes up most of the key's beach. This includes the dock, a number of buildings housing cells, a canteen tent, a work tent, and a separate building housing the Warden's office and quarters. The solid buildings are constructed of coral slabs, and all but the Warden's office are close enough to the waterline to be flooded by a foot or so of water at high tide.

The canteen and work tents support the island's second function as a work camp. During the day there are three shifts of work hours during which prisoners are escorted inland in parties to the Triton ruins for crude excavation and archaeology efforts. Ancient statues and trinkets found by prisoners are shipped to Warwood at the end of every day to be appraised for value and eventually sold to fund Waris efforts in the region.

## Ruins and Dungeons

The Triton temple ruins situated on the highest point of the key are the only structures that pre-date the relatively recent Waris occupation. The body of these structures are constructed of a smooth, green-black volcanic stone cut into geometrically perfect blocks. These blocks are far too heavy to move, as Waris Naval Officers were quick to discover, and are locked in place by their weight and shape rather than by mortar or mud.

Both the interiors and exteriors are adorned by wall-mounted torches enchanted to burn forever, even when submerged, as well as a plethora of ornate busts, statues, andÂ  other sculptures carved both from the volcanic stone and natural coral. These features depict ancient Triton heroes of legend, recognizable visages of the Gods, and aquatic creatures both familiar and bizarre. The largest of these by far stands nearly 12 feet tall in the main room of the temple and depicts a stoic Triton champion using a trident to skewer a foe. The fallen enemy also appears to be a Triton, but is depicted with fangs and reptile-like eyes. Above and behind the hero floats an almost angelic depiction of a figure that must be some God you are not familiar with.

On a recent excavation shift, an undiscovered doorway was revealed. This doorway leads to an almost labyrinthine series of hallways and chambers which the Warden and his guards have expressed is the primary focus of most shifts.
