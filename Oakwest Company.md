**The Oakwest Company** is a massive import/export and manufacturing corporation based in the [[Midmark|City of Midmark]], which it also stewards as its corpocratic rulers. It is not just ubiquitous in the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]], but has quite literally put it on the map through a monopoly on newfound trade routes between far off continents to the east and west.

Originally founded after the [[Midmark Revolution]] by several of the very pirates who orchestrated it, the Company took advantage of the [[Waris Imperial Navy]]'s absence to become the wealthiest and most powerful faction in the region.

## Business & Industry in Esterrane

Trading and feuding with surrounding nations with their trademark ruthless negotiation skills

Much of the Company's profits come instead from expertly managed smuggling and privateering efforts

### Manufacturing Empire



### Import/Export Monopoly

The Oakwest Company turns quite a profit from its position between the Sword Coast to the East and Krynn to the West: both from its own shipping endeavors and from the fees and taxes on corporate vessels docking there. It lies several weeks of sea travel between the two regions and acts as a sort of refueling station for both shipping vessels and passenger vessels.

### State-of-the-art Telecommunications

In recent decades, the Company has also been at the forefront of an exciting new industry: *techno-magical telecommunications*. These great works have made the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]] a hub of technological invention as much as it is a mecca of worship and strange magics.

Their first foray into this field was the creation of the now ubiquitous [[Master Chart]] in collaboration with the [[Explorers Society#Explorers Society of Midmark|Explorers Society of Midmark]]. This massive navigational chart – which sits on display at [[Oakwest House]] in [[Midmark]] – is a powerful instrument that communicates with lesser enchanted charts throughout the region, allowing civilian sailors and navigators to see the latest updates to the Master in real time. It has been continually updated over the last half a century and all are encouraged to report new discoveries to the Society for a reasonable commission upon verification. Today, it is extremely detailed, with landmarks charted on nearly every island in Esterrane.

A more recent collaboration with the [[Gondar of Powderkeep Blackmetal|Gondar]] of [[Powderkeep Blackmetal]] has yielded the Company's [[Sending Slab|Sending Slab Network]], which allows for verbal communication across great distances. All are are carved from a single stone found found by [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotauran]] [[Western Isles Expansion|expansionists]] in the [[Western Isles]]. Each large slab is connected to all others and is able to be operated similarly to *sending stones* but with significantly augmented range. Though this range is not great enough to connect any of the region's major port cities, messages are relayed between ships and a growing number of permanent waystations. 

## Power in Midmark

Sticking to their old beliefs of freedom from tyranny, Oakwest Company only lightly taxes the people of Midmark and largely leaves them to their own devices.
