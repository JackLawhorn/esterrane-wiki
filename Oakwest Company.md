**The Oakwest Company** is a massive import/export and manufacturing corporation based in the [[Midmark|City of Midmark]], which it also stewards as its corpocratic rulers. It is not just ubiquitous across the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]], but has quite literally put it on the map through a monopoly on newfound trade routes between far off continents to the east and west.

Originally founded after the [[Midmark Revolution]] by several of the very pirates who orchestrated it, the Company took advantage of the [[Waris Imperial Navy]]'s absence to become the wealthiest and most powerful faction in the region.

## Business & Industry in Esterrane

The Oakwest Company has taken a number of forms throughout its near-century of existence, evolving from an operation borne of necessity into a titan of industry and major political power. While the Company openly engaged in smuggling and privateering in its early years, it has since pivoted to what appears to be an entirely legitimate operation. Still, they are known for their ruthless negotiation skills both common to those devoted to [[Gods & Deities#Waukeen|Waukeen, the Merchant's Friend]] and leftover from their origins as pirates of [[Thieves' Hole]].

### Manufacturing & Construction Empire

In the aftermath of the [[Midmark Revolution]], the city – then known by its [[Waris Empire|Waris]] [[Waris Colonization|colonial]] name, *Arkaver* – was still just a barebones frontier settlement with most permanent structures being centers of naval leadership. Seeing the needs of the people here, the pirates who led the revolution began working with a devoted workforce of those healthy and able-bodied from among the liberated to develop much needed structures, infrastructure, and seafaring vessels.

From these projects sprung the Oakwest Company, founded by former pirates attracted to this new life as heroes of the revolution. The next decade of construction efforts laid the groundwork for the city that exists today, and the Company is now ubiquitous as a major manufacturing power. In every port across the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]] – even in [[Warwood]] where colonists still hold decades-old grudges against [[Midmark]] – you'll find Oakwest manufactured crates, cranes, and vessels branded with their merchant's mark.

Only recently has their renown in this field been contested by the [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotaurs]] of [[New Mithas]] with their mastery of shipwrighting and the inexhaustible progress of their [[Western Isles Expansion|expansion]] into the [[Western Isles]].

### Import/Export Monopoly

With the discovery of new trade routes between distant lands to the east and west, the Company was catapulted to a new level of wealth and influence. These far-off ports are several weeks away by sea in either direction, with [[Esterrane]] serving as the sole bunkering port on the route between them. Leveraging their manufacturing operation and [[Midmark]]'s key position on the [[Southern Rim]], they engineered an iron-clad monopoly on all import/export into and out of the region. The Company profits heavily from fees and taxes levied against all vessels docking in the [[Port of Midmark]], as well as from the wide variety of goods brought through it.

The import of travelers especially has made the Sea of Esterrane the destination that it is today, bringing customers and gold not only to the Company but also to independent business ventures in Midmark, [[Warwood]], and [[New Mithas]]. Even the [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole]] has benefited from the influx of seafaring vessels prime for raiding. For this reason, most factions and major powers rely on the trade routes just as much as the Company does and are unable to openly work against their interests.

Furthermore, it has entirely transformed the population. Sailors, explorers, merchants, and adventurers from all manner of cultures – and even other worlds – come here for one reason or another, and many find themselves staying for life. The most significant example of this is the [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotaurs]] from a land called *Krynn* to the west, who founded the sprawling frontier city of New Mithas and are now themselves a major power in the region.

### State-of-the-art Telecommunications

In recent decades, the Company has also been at the forefront of an exciting new industry: *techno-magical telecommunications*. These great works have made the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]] a hub of technological invention as much as it is a mecca of worship and strange magics.

Their first foray into this field was the creation of the now ubiquitous [[Master Chart]] in collaboration with the [[Explorers Society#Explorers Society of Midmark|Explorers Society of Midmark]]. This massive navigational chart – which sits on display at [[Oakwest House]] in [[Midmark]] – is a powerful instrument that communicates with lesser enchanted charts throughout the region, allowing civilian sailors and navigators to see the latest updates to the Master in real time. It has been continually updated over the last half a century and all are encouraged to report new discoveries to the Society for a reasonable commission upon verification. Today, it is extremely detailed, with landmarks charted on nearly every island in Esterrane.

A more recent collaboration with the [[Gondar of Powderkeep Blackmetal|Gondar]] of [[Powderkeep Blackmetal]] has yielded the Company's [[Sending Slab|Sending Slab Network]], which allows for verbal communication across great distances. All are are carved from a single stone found in the [[Western Isles]] by [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotauran]] [[Western Isles Expansion|expansionists]]. Each large slab is connected to all others and is able to be operated similarly to *sending stones* but with significantly augmented range. Though this range is not great enough to connect any of the region's major port cities, messages are relayed between ships and a growing number of permanent waystations.

## Power in Midmark

The Oakwest Company serves as the steward and de facto ruler of the [[Midmark|City of Midmark]], the gleaming crown jewel of the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]]. At first, the source of their political power was a great amount of public goodwill garnered from their role in liberating the labor colony of *Arkaver* from the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] and building it up into the city that stands today. In the near century since then, the immense wealth and influence they've acquired from various, wildly successful business ventures has cemented their power here in Midmark and positioned them as the most powerful faction in all of Esterrane. Power and wealth flows into the region through the [[Port of Midmark]], and so the Company also largely controls the means of survival for many of their political rivals.

The Company only lightly taxes the people of Midmark and largely leaves them to their own devices. Their political and financial interests are protected by the [[Company Men]] both in the city and elsewhere, and civilian rights and interests are protected by a great number of [[Civilian Lobbies]].

### The Company Men

The Company Men are a militia, security force, and law enforcement agency privately owned by the Oakwest Company and tasked with protecting their political and financial interests. They can be found watching over the streets of [[Midmark]], inspecting vessels and collecting taxes at its [[Port of Midmark|port]], and patrolling nearby waters. They have a more limited presence outside of the city, but can be found nearly anywhere Company manufacturing, construction, shipping, or trade takes place.

### The Civilian Lobbies

While the Company holds total political power in [[Midmark]], a number of independent political parties – called the Civilian Lobbies – exist to advocate for the issues that matter to non-affiliated citizens. These groups are able to push back on anti-civilian pricing, taxes, and policies, and can challenge detainments made by the [[Company Men]].

Each acts as a guild or union for a particular issue, industry, or class. For example, the [[Merchants and Traders of Esterrane]] fights for protection from raids by the pirates of [[Thieves' Hole]] which threaten their livelihoods.

## Patron Deities

The Oakwest Company claims the patronage of both [[Gods & Deities#Waukeen|Waukeen, Merchant's Friend]] who brought them immense wealth, and [[Gods & Deities#Shaundakul|Shaundakul, Rider of the Winds]] whose favorable winds connected the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]] to vital trade routes. Much of the [[Oakwest House]] in [[Midmark#The Hub|the Hub]] serves as a Waukeenar temple, bustling with lavishly dressed clerics draped in gilded scarlet cloaks heavy with the weight of gold trinkets. The faction hall also has halls dedicated to [[minor deities of the easterly and westerly winds]], which also serve as accommodations for new and potential business partners visiting from far away lands.

In its earlier years, the Company was more closely tied to the [[Gods & Deities#Deities of Knowledge & Invention|Deities of Knowledge & Invention]], especially [[Gods & Deities#Gond|Gond, the Wonderbringer]] and [[Gods & Deities#Oghma|Oghma, the Lord of Knowledge]]. To this day, they remain closely aligned with the [[Gondar of Powderkeep Blackmetal|Gondar]] of [[Powderkeep Blackmetal]] and the [[Explorers Society]].

## Allies & Enemies

As both a corporate enterprise and a ruling political faction in [[Midmark]], the Oakwest Company has a great many allies and enemies; and it is not always so easy to know which is which.

The [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole]] – from which the Company's own founders came – threaten the merchant vessels that bring wealth and power into the [[Port of Midmark]]. The [[Waris Loyalists]] of [[Warwood]] may not have been much of a threat, but the future is less certain now that the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] has returned to [[Esterrane]]. The [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotaurs]] of [[New Mithas]] are simultaneously frequent collaborators – the [[Western Isles Expansion]] has been wildly profitable for both factions – and the Company's greatest political threat, with New Mithas positioned to rival Midmark itself. Key to maintaining peace between all of these parties is [[Madame Katherine]] and her [[Ladies of the Court]], whose political connections are said to hold all of Esterrane together.

The Company makes a habit of entering into profitable business partnerships with the region's non-political factions. They have worked with the [[Explorers Society#Explorers Society of Midmark|Explorers Society of Midmark]] for over half a century to create and update the [[Master Chart]] of Esterrane. Much more recently, they've collaborated with the [[Gondar of Powderkeep Blackmetal|Gondar]] of [[Powderkeep Blackmetal]], to develop the [[Sending Slab|Sending Slab Network]] which connects vessels at sea via techno-magical telecommunication.

## Rumors & Mysteries

The Oakwest Company's strange relationship with the [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole]] – which its own origins are traced back to – is a common source of speculation. While the Company's import/export business with far away lands to the east and west appears on its surface to be entirely legitimate, pirate raids on the merchant vessels of their clients have grown increasingly rare over the last decades. Some claim a kind of symbiotic relationship between the two related factions by which the threat of raids is used as a cudgel to force travelling merchants into paying the Company for protection in a kind of large-scale protection racket.
