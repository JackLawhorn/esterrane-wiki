**Midmark** is the de facto capital of the region, the gleaming crown jewel of the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]]. From this tropical port city situated on the sea's [[Southern Rim]], the ubiquitous [[Oakwest Company]] maintains an iron-clad monopoly over a valuable trade route between two distant land masses.

The city takes her current name from this fortunate position as the only known port between the *Isle of Mithas* to the west-southwest and the *Sword Coast* to the east. This trade route has brought unbelievable opportunity, power, and wealth flowing through the [[#The Port of Midmark|Port of Midmark]] and all of Esterrane.

## Welcome to Midmark

It is said that the [[#History of Midmark|history]] of Midmark is the history of all of Esterrane: stolen from the indigenous [[Tritons|Tritons]] by the [[Waris Imperial Navy]], built by [[interplanar refugees]], appropriated by the [[Pirate Lords]] of [[Thieves' Hole]], settled by the [[Oakwest Company]], and transformed by a trade route between far-off lands. Today she is a deeply multicultural destination – vibrant, metropolitan, and surprisingly modern for a frontier settlement.

Without many regulations on business, the poor are poorer and the rich richer than in her sister city of [[Warwood]], but that doesn't seem to bother most. Everyone is moving about with purpose whether they’re hard at work or hardly working. There's something infectious, freeing about the energy here, a feeling that you're standing at the center of the world.

Midmarkers are a proud and hardworking but fun-loving and liberally-minded people. While diverse, they all have one attribute in common: a free spirit and resistance against control. Natives – both the indigenous Tritons and those whose refugee ancestors built this city – have a shared history of oppression at the hands of the [[Waris Empire]]. Each newcomer – a transplant, an immigrant, a refugee, a tourist, an opportunist, a dreamer – finds something here, recognizes something within themselves here.

## Districts & Landmarks

The City of Midmark is comprised of three major economic districts: the [[The Docks|Docks]] (lower-class district), the [[The Hub|Hub]] (middle-class district), and the [[The Town|Town]] (high-class district). These areas spread out from the [[#The Port of Midmark|Port of Midmark]] in rings spanning up the hill, and both the Docks and Hub are divided into racially-based subdistricts. These dividing lines were initially enforced by the Empire to mitigate the effects of a population boom, but these laws have since been abolished under the [[Oakwest Company]]. Now they are merely neighborhoods that are still heavily influenced by the culture of the predominant race, and excellent places to find ethnic food and diverse social hubs.

### The Port of Midmark

You pass smaller craft like fishing vessels and the ships of wreck recovery workers, and eventually two guard towers on opposite sides of the port's mouth.

Zipping between the left and right side of this channel are hundreds if not thousands of water taxis and ferries commissioned by the denizens of the [[The Docks|Docks]]. On either side, hundreds of boats ranging from dingeys to yachts to massive shipping and fishing vessels are docked. Past the docks you can multi-story apartment blocks, open-air markets, various restaurants, taverns, and shops.
