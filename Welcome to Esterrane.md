**[[Esterrane]]** is a small, remote sea caged by a diverse chain of islands. This [[The crescent|crescent]], as it is often described, separates the sea by weeks of travel in every direction.

First discovered by the known world some hundred years ago, this land was coveted for its tropical climate, latent magical properties, and the fertility of its volcanic soil. For these reasons, it was quickly colonized by the Waris Empire who used it to expand their wealth of natural resources and the viability of their trade routes. As Esterrane's islands are well positioned between the heartland of the Empire and several exotic trade ports like Krynn and Ixalan, the land developed as a go between and hub of ship-building and fishing industry.

Under Imperial rule, the people of Esterrane were allowed to live mostly peaceful, if not controlled, lives. It was during this time, however, that the first seeds of rebellion were sewn. The distance from the colonies to Waris's own soil, several weeks on the treacherous sea in the best of cases, meant that challenges to their rule were all the more dangerous. The relative seclusion and privacy afforded by the sea's island chains made perfect homes for thieves, killers, and rebels who wished to dwell beyond the reach of the colonizers. When the first skirmishes of what would become the Long War began developing overseas much of the Imperial Navy was called away, leaving the Governors of Esterrane without protection from a new threat: pirates.

Over the course of a hundred years, Esterrane changed greatly. Without the protection of the Empire, power fell initially into the hands of anyone with the ship, crew, and willpower required to plunder the sea. The Governors were either bribed or killed and replaced with those who would bend to those really in power. With the people of Esterrane now in command, the once lone pirate captains came together to form the Oakwest Company in order to lead and eventually peace was achieved again. This group, a semi-respectable front for an organized smugglers guild, continues to provide protection and leadership to the major ports and all tax-paying citizens.

After decades of this peace, the first storm clouds are beginning to roll in once again from the East. With the end to the Long War and the Waris Empire's eventual return to economic prosperity in their own lands, the first Imperial ships have returned to find that their cities and people are now led by an old enemy.

## Pirates in Esterrane
- Prior to Waris leaving the region, bands of pirates existed in limited numbers as thieves looking to steal what they could from the Navy, but tended to be crushed rather quickly by the Navy's greater numbers and resources. The few who survived would end up joining forces to incite Midmark's Rebellion and eventually formed the Oakwest Company.
- Depending on the author's own perspective, published accounts of the Oakwest Company's uprising in Midmark are painted as either a glorious revolution inspired by Basinhelm wherein persecuted peoples of several races seized control from an oppressive government, or a coup by a violent and greedy gang of pirates-turned-corporate-thieves to benefit only their own self interests.
- Since then, pirates have largely been allowed to operate in the region as long as they do not work against the Oakwest Company's own interests. Many seek official Privateering Licenses which grants them immunity to many acts of piracy as well as the occasional gig to maintain the Company's control of the region. Others believed that the Company itself is a threat to Esterrane in much the same way as the Empire was and chose to form the Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole.
- Thieves' Hole is only really a minor nuisance to the Company at best since most members know better than to act against them, choosing instead to target random shipping vessels passing through the region and occasionally the odd coastal settlement. Though many of these marauders are fierce and brutal criminals whose names are well known in Esterrane, there are few pirate lords who would be well known outside of the region.
- One that academics researching the region might know of is Captain Sirmir the Inscrutable, a Tiefling pirate lord who played an instrumental part in founding Thieves' Hole and remains an active member of the Council. Sirmir vehemently despises both the Oakwest Company and those who act as privateers under their command.

## Unexplained Magical Phenomena
- Myths and theories of the Sea of Esterrane's latent magical properties have been widely publicized and oft published in academic materials, although they've never been categorically defined or even proven. Most "evidence" is comprised of anecdotal accounts of unexplained phenomena and circumstantial rationalizations of events like the portal to Ixalan.
- Many old sea dogs have drunken tales of the sea's waters consciously leading them astray or even guiding them home, mysterious lights floating on the water, strange gods and other entities making themselves known, entire crews experiencing haunting dreams, and a number of other unlikely phenomena. Others still will claim that the salt water can grant a man extraordinary abilities or heal ailments.
- The connection to Ixalan is understood even less than many of these other phenomena due to the brief existence of the interplanar rift and its location in the barren Arctic Rim of the region. A few decades after the Waris Empire's initial colonization of the region, a number of foreign races made their way from this opening to the (relatively) nearby capital of Warwood. This mass immigration and Waris's own views of monstrous races largely influenced the shift to Midmark in an attempt to make space for the increased population of the region.
- The most common theories behind these events are that 1) the veil between our world and the Gods is thinner in Esterrane for whatever reason, 2) ancient Triton magics and technology permanently affected the region in some unknown way, and 3) the water itself has latent magical properties. Each of these theories is as valid and as unproven as the next, but one or more of them might one day be confirmed.
