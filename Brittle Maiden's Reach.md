**Brittle Maiden's Reach** is the northernmost stretch of the [[Esterrane]]'s [[The crescent|crescent]], where the tropical climate gives way to arctic cold. Though this strange microclimate has not been explained by the [[Explorers Society]] nor by the region's other academics, the people here have largely attributed this to the fury of the eponymous goddess [[Auril]].
