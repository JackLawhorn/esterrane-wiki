**The Explorers Society** is an apolitical, mostly scholarly faction with headquarters in [[Warwood]], [[Midmark]], and in the [[Western Isles Expansion]]. Since its founding, it has worked towards three primary goals outlined in its [[Tripartite Mission]]:

1. To chart every island and landmark in the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]].
2. To understand the region's strange [[extraplanar phenomena]].
3. To discover the region's [[Triton ruins]] and to uncover the secrets of [[their people's lost history]], magics, and technology.

## Society Chapters & Membership

### Explorers Society of Warwood

In the Society's first iteration, its membership was comprised not just of well-respected scholars but also famous adventurers and even heroes in their own right. The **Explorers Society of Warwood** was structured as an exclusive social club for expeditioners and the wealthy patrons financing them. Though unaffiliated with the [[Waris Imperial Navy]], its membership was primarily comprised of celebrated admirals, some particularly well-connected officers, and only the wealthiest of civilians – mostly independently wealthy cartographical hobbyists, scientific researchers, and other academics.

As a social club, little formal leadership existed. Influence among the membership was primarily a product of seniority, though great deference was also given to the wealthiest of members whose investments funded many others' expeditions. These leaders comprised an informal in-group called the [[Explorers Society of Warwood#The Sapphire Spyglass|Sapphire Spyglass]].

### Explorers Society of Midmark

In the aftermath of the [[Midmark Revolution]], the Society would face a splintering. Ultimately, the **Explorers Society of Midmark** – based in what was now the seat of power in [[Esterrane]] – would rise in prominence as the [[#Explorers Society of Warwood|Warwood chapter]] would largely fade into obscurity. In its new iteration, the Society's membership would be in stark contrast to its predecessor, comprised entirely of civilians and primarily the working class. The [[Midmark]] chapter opened its membership policy and refocused its efforts on the [[Tripartite Mission]], greatly expanding both the Society's reach and influence, and the size of its membership. Everyday people – and even [[pirates]] – were encouraged to share their discoveries in exchange for a widely publicized commission upon confirmation. This practice in particular has lead to the development of the [[Oakwest Company]]'s now-ubiquitous [[Master Chart]].

In recent decades, major discoveries have become farther and fewer between, and public interest in the project has lessened in parallel. By the dawn of the Society's third century, the flashy discoveries and fantastic tales were nothing more than memories regaled again and again by an aged membership prone to vainglorious boasting while sat in the smoky parlor rooms of their chapters in Warwood and Midmark.

### Explorers Society Western Isles Chapter

In the last decade, with the recent migration of [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotauran]] refugees from the west and their founding of [[New Mithas]], a new opportunity kindled a new influx in membership: the [[Western Isles Expansion]]. This project was largely ignored by the Society, who's remaining membership was not too motivated to work with the Minotauran workers – themselves not too curious about historical artifacts and less than cautious in their work – until a string of significant discoveries across this frontier and Esterrane's [[Southern Rim]] by younger upstart [[Aymar Qiris]].

After these developments, all of Esterrane rushed at once to seize the power and opportunity these discoveries represented. Likewise, Qiris has leveraged this newfound interest to unite his more liberally-minded colleagues in the founding of the **Explorers Society Western Isles Chapter**. The Chapter's members join the joint Company-Minotauran expeditions in an attempt to preserve any ruins or artifacts in advance of the ever-advancing wave of the Expansion.

## Patron Deities

The Explorers Society is not an expressly faithful organization nor is it sponsored by any particular church, but as a scholarly institution it places great importance on the [[Gods & Deities#Deities of Knowledge & Invention|Deities of Knowledge and Invention]], especially their leader [[Gods & Deities#Oghma|Oghma, Binder of What is Known]] and his former exarch [[Gods & Deities#Deneir|Deneir, Lord of All Glyphs and Images]]. Some in the Society's ranks are clerics to one or the other – *Namers* or *glyphscribes* respectively – but most do not engage in worship of these deities any further than most in their fields.

More common among the Society's membership is worship of [[Gods & Deities#Shaundakul|Shaundakul, Rider of Winds]], whose portfolio includes travel, exploration, and portals. Many will wear his holy symbol – a wind-walking bearded man in traveler's cape and boots – on the back of their gauntlet while in the field. And on hundreds if not thousands of islands around the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]], one can find a small throne of stacked stones also adorning this symbol, for it is a common ritual to mark any newly charted territory with such a shrine.

Another deity who sees significant worship among member as well as from navigators all throughout Esterrane is [[Gods & Deities#Selûne|Selûne, the Moonmaiden]], whose portfolio includes the moon, navigation, and questers. The Selûnite faith began to grow significantly after the founding of the [[#Explorers Society of Midmark]], in parallel with increased female membership.

## Allies & Enemies

The Explorers Society has formed close connections with many of the major players in [[Esterrane]] over more than two centuries of history.

Despite having been founded in the colony of [[Warwood]], the greater Society now maintains only a faint connection to its old home and to the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] whose officers comprised much of its [[#Society Membership|membership]]. While members of the other Chapters may not face persecution when they find themselves in Warwood, it is well known that they are shown little kindness or collaboration by her colonists who still hold something of a grudge to this day.

Much closer are the Society's ties to the [[Midmark|City of Midmark]] which has served as its headquarters since the [[Midmark Revolution]]. The [[Explorers Society of Midmark]] operates within the bounds of its contract with the Company – from which both parties have profited greatly. Perhaps the greatest example has been the creation of the Company's [[Master Chart]], a grand instrument through which the Society has effectively completed the first and oldest goal of its [[Tripartite Mission]]: *To chart every island and landmark in the Sea of Esterrane*.

In recent times, the Society has also found itself entangled with the [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotaurs]] of [[New Mithas]]. Under the banner of the newly founded [[Explorers Society Western Isles Chapter]], they have joined the ever-advancing wave of the [[Western Isles Expansion]], charged with surveying the [[Triton ruins]] and recovering any artifacts they come across. To the Minotaurs, the cautious and exacting nature of the Society's scholars .

As a largely apolitical organization, the Society's enemies are far and few between. The pirates of [[Thieves' Hole]] hold no ill will against them, but have been known to capture expeditions into the still largely uncharted [[Lawless East]] where their [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole|Republic]] lies hidden. More hostile are certain corners of Esterrane's [[Tritons|Triton]] population, many of whom see the Society's works – especially the third goal of their Tripartite Mission: *To discover the region's Triton ruins and to uncover the secrets of [[their people's lost history]], magics, and technology* – as one of the greatest threats to their sovereignty and culture.
