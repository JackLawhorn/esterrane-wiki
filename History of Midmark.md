## Indigenous Tritons of Midmark

The indigenous [[Tritons|Tritons]] call the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]]'s [[Southern Rim]] *Eadro's Cradle* and know this island by the name *Merrouroboros*. The tribe that first settled this place – called *Jhimarath* – are master craftsmen of ornate coral artifacts, practice scarring rituals, and tell legends of a powerful *mythal* cast by ancestors in ages past.

## Waris Colonization

The [[Waris Imperial Navy]] first make contact with the Jhimarath soon after founding the colony of [[Warwood]] to the north, but do not return to settle here until the start of their [[second century]] in the region. Warwood had proven a valuable source of natural resources for the [[Waris Empire]], and a second colony within the Southern Rim's far more hospitable subtropical climate is an attractive opportunity for the navy.

The tribe holds only coastal settlements on Merrouroboros – which is common for the Esterranean Tritons – and the navy is able to establish themselves further inland and partway up the island's prominent hill face. They call this new colony *Arkaver*.

Many of its founders are members of the [[Explorers Society#The Explorers Society of Warwood|Explorers Society of Warwood]] who preoccupy themselves with uncovering the anthropological insights that their dealings with the Jhimarath afford them. The others see Arkaver as a gateway to the rest of the region and perhaps even a new capital of Waris's presence here.

[[Thirteen years later]], Warwood faces an existential threat in the form of interplanar excursions across the frigid wastes of [[Brittle Maiden's Reach]] to the north and an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from a plane called *Ixalan*. Less than one year after these incursions, the Waris Imperial Navy forcibly move these refugees south due to mounting unrest in Warwood. The island quickly degrades into little more than a ghetto and its new inheritors are tasked with building the foundation of what would become the City of Midmark.

For [[nearly 25 years]], they labor under naval rule before word comes that naval forces are being recalled for a war in the Waris homeland back east. With only minimal naval presence remaining in the region to govern the sister colonies of Warwood and Arkaver, the latter quickly sees a rise in violence and navy reprisals in turn.

## The Midmark Revolution

The [[Pirate Lords]] of the still-young [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole|Independent Republic]] of [[Thieves' Hole]] quickly move to leverage the tension in Arkaver in a massive coordinated invasion by sea. and overthrow naval rule in what is now remembered as the [[Midmark Revolution]].
