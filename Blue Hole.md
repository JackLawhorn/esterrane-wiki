The **Blue Hole** is the vast expanse of open ocean furthest from the landmasses that make up the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]]'s iconic [[The crescent|crescent]]. This area is well known to be as treacherous as it is remote and today the region's taverns are home to several centuries of legends and superstitions about its strange properties and perils.

## Sub-regions

Embarking in a straight line into the heart of the Blue Hole, vessels first enter a ring commonly called the [[#The Outer Blue|Outer Blue]] before eventually finding themselves in the [[#The Inner Blue|Inner Blue]]. Neither the boundaries of the Blue Hole itself nor the border between these distinct areas have been formally demarcated; in fact, they are widely purported to ebb and flow like the tides themselves.

### The Outer Blue

Though the boundaries of the Blue Hole have yet to be formally demarcated by the [[Explorers Society]], lifelong sailors will swear that there is a palpable shift in the atmosphere when crossing into its waters. Winds and ocean currents change speed and direction; sturdy, well-built vessels creak under the influence of unexplained forces; and even the toughest of crews have their mettle tested by threats both real and imagined.

Vessels rarely traverse the Blue Hole. The vast majority of those that do will cross into the Outer Blue to catch favorable winds and take a straight shot through to save a day or two of travel before crossing back out just as quickly. Staying any longer puts a crew's chances of making the trip back to land in jeopardy.

The Blue Hole's greatest dangers seem to be native to the [[#The Inner Blue|Inner Blue]], but occasionally cross into the shallower waters of this outermost ring. Assaults by giant sea beasts, nightly [[Sahuagin]] raiding parties, and freak storms are common enough to deter even the bravest of pirates and the most desperate of shipping vessels.

### The Inner Blue

Few willing enter the Outer Blue, but none save the eccentric [[Water Peddlers]] cross over into the even more treacherous Inner Blue. The threat of attack by the inhabitants of these waters is greater; the sea beasts grow to be even larger here, the [[Sahuagin]] raiding parties are brazen enough to hunt during daylight hours; and the storms here are known to last weeks and wander distances of several miles.

Early expeditions by the [[Explorers Society]] indicated that the ocean floor here exceeds depths measurable by modern magical and technological means. 

## Mysteries of the Blue Hole

Since the earliest expeditions by the [[Explorers Society]], there has grown a vast economy of speculation around the Blue Hole and what mysteries its inky black depths hold, spawning myths and legends that today can be hard to separate from truth.

### Ancient Triton settlements

Expeditions throughout nearly every part of [[Esterrane]]'s [[The crescent|crescent]] have uncovered [[ancient Triton]] artifacts, ruins, and settlements. While some are still yet to be fully understood by the learned membership of the [[Explorers Society]], it is thought that that last great find remains somewhere within the depths of the Blue Hole – and possibly even in the dark heart of the [[#The Inner Blue|Inner Blue]] itself.

The indigenous Tritons of today – having famously [[lost their people's history]] long ago – offer few insights into this mysterious past, but depictions have been found of strange magics and technologies that suggest a highly advanced theocratic society. Another common theme in the recovered artworks is a large rift, sometimes depicted as a door or gateway. Though no further explanation of this supposed landmark has been found, some believe it to be a stable portal to the [[elemental plane of water]].

### Sahuagin of the Inner Blue

The frequency of [[Sahuagin]] attacks suggests that they call the depths of the [[#The Inner Blue|Inner Blue]] home, but some go further: telling tales of a dark fortress far beneath the reach of the sun's light. This race of coastal raiders seem even more ravenous when encountered inside the bounds of the Blue Hole, and those who have survived their assaults tell tale of strange mutations and powerful warlocks to ancient gods amongst their ranks.

### There's something in the water

Perhaps the most widely spread superstition related to the Blue Hole is that whatever causes these strange phenomena have lent the water here any number of minor magical properties. People throughout [[Esterrane]] frequent the ships and market stalls of merchants of dubious credibility looking for salt water-based tinctures purported to treat or cure any number of maladies and event to grant good fortune. Of course these [[Water Peddlers]] claim their wares come from the [[#The Inner Blue|Inner Blue]] but only a few true believers are willing to brave these treacherous waters.
