Madame Katherine is allied with the Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole because she's seen firsthand how both corporations like the Oakwest Company and political entities like the Waris Empire can abuse their power over those beneath them. By helping this rag tag group of pirates with her political knowhow and lending a bit of legitimacy to their operation, she hopes to protect the freedom that it represents, that the Oakwest Company used to represent, and that the Waris Empire stands against.

## Personal History

Katherine grew up on the streets of the Waris capital of Bleigh as an orphaned street urchin. After an imperial initiative to rid the streets of beggars and the homeless by placing them in menial positions around the city, she was hand selected by an advisor of the court as his concubine (at far too young an age). Enduring the trauma and humiliation of her position until she was an adult, she would eventually be pushed to poison her master when he brought in a new, younger mistress whom she sought to protect. Forging a new will and enlisting the young girl in her plot, she was never suspected of the death and even inherited the advisor's wealth.

- Something about a tie to a cult of Sharess/Bast based in the Waris home country
- Pleasure, charm, beauty, secrets, night, vengeance

After acquiring this fortune and spending some years growing it up and down the Sword Coast, she brought her enterprise to Esterrane and its emerging independence. In the Oakwest Company's early years, it served as a voice of the people first and as a corporation second. Making herself and her resources available to these burgeoning leaders, both parties benefitted greatly, getting her to the place she's in now.

## Madame Katherine's Secret

Katherine is in a secret relationship with Captain Grimlock Stormbrow of the Storm Raider. As an eccentric yet politically level-headed voice in Thieves' Hole, and perhaps most importantly a rival to her anarchist counterpart Pirate Lord Sirmir the Inscrutable, he offered her a look at a simpler life she never had the chance to experience. As he tends not to get caught up in politics, she has little fear of being used for her power and influence, and the relationship is very casual. Still, relationships are a difficult subject matter for her because of her past and she knows her respect among the other members of the Council would take a hit if the secret were to come out.

## When has she failed?

She considers it her greatest shame and failure that she remained under her vile master's control for so many years. Resolving never to stand by while another girl went through the same experience, she formed the Ladies of the Court. Each member of this elite squad of assassins, bodyguards, and spies were pulled from nothing as poor, abused, or lost young girls. Arming them with a purpose, she hopes to right just a few of the wrongs of the world, although whether the ideals she's put in their heads are right is questionable.
