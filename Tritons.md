Overview

`The tritons, like the [ixitxachitl](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ixitxachitl "Ixitxachitl"), were a completely theocratic society. All but those rare outcasts had some kind of connection to Persana's church who had many undersea cities built for him by his followers. Persana's priests would readily aid those of other faiths—as would the deity himself—as long as the end result benefited the tritons.

## Mysteries of the Ancient Tritons

First and foremost, the indigenous Tritons of [[Esterrane]] are a people without a history. When the [[Waris Empire]] [[Waris Colonization|colonized]] the region, these amphibious natives had already been there for generations, thriving in scattered coastal settlements. When asked by the colonizers why they lived on land while in possession of their aquatic abilities, the local Triton chiefs merely expressed that their place was not beneath the sea anymore.

After centuries, the meaning of this cryptic explanation and almost everything else the tritons knew about their past has fallen into obscurity. With the passing of the old traditions and further integration into the colonizers' society, most go about their lives like any other citizen. Now their aquatic abilities are largely used for fishing and scavenging endeavors while the triton population remains primarily on land.

### Undiscovered Secrets

Relatively much has been learned about the tritons in the past decade. A newfound trove of ancient triton artifacts has suggest that there was indeed at some point an underwater settlement deep below the sea of Esterrane. What little artifacts have been found by the Explorers' Guild are evidence that the ancient tritons possessed both great magical and technological prowess.

### Triton Anatomy
- Their blue skin color has darkened one or two shades after a millennium above the sea and within the reach of the Sun's rays
- Their iconic leg fins have also shown signs of evolution, shrinking noticeably in size as they spend much more time walking on land than swimming in the water
- Lastly, and perhaps most strangely, nearly every one of Esterrane's Tritons possesses dark blue birthmarks somewhere on their body. The size, shape, and number of these spots varies greatly from Triton to Triton. Scholars suspect a genetic source due to the fact that these patterns typically resemble those of the wearer's parents, but it seems that Tribal legends ascribed great value to the placement and size of these markings.
