## Madame Katherine

Madame Katherine is allied with the Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole because she's seen firsthand how both corporations like the Oakwest Company and political entities like the Waris Empire can abuse their power over those beneath them. By helping this rag tag group of pirates with her political knowhow and lending a bit of legitimacy to their operation, she hopes to protect the freedom that it represents, that the Oakwest Company used to represent, and that the Waris Empire stands against.

Katherine grew up on the streets of the Waris capital of Bleigh as an orphaned street urchin. After an imperial initiative to rid the streets of beggars and the homeless by placing them in menial positions around the city, she was hand selected by an advisor of the court as his concubine (at far too young an age). Enduring the trauma and humiliation of her position until she was an adult, she would eventually be pushed to poison her master when he brought in a new, younger mistress whom she sought to protect. Forging a new will and enlisting the young girl in her plot, she was never suspected of the death and even inherited the advisor's wealth.

After acquiring this fortune and spending some years growing it up and down the Sword Coast, she brought her enterprise to Esterrane and its emerging independence. In the Oakwest Company's early years, it served as a voice of the people first and as a corporation second. Making herself and her resources available to these burgeoning leaders, both parties benefitted greatly, getting her to the place she's in now.

Katherine is in a secret relationship with Captain Grimlock Stormbrow of the Storm Raider. As an eccentric yet politically level-headed voice in Thieves' Hole, and perhaps most importantly a rival to her anarchist counterpart Pirate Lord Sirmir the Inscrutable, he offered her a look at a simpler life she never had the chance to experience. As he tends not to get caught up in politics, she has little fear of being used for her power and influence, and the relationship is very casual. Still, relationships are a difficult subject matter for her because of her past and she knows her respect among the other members of the Council would take a hit if the secret were to come out.

She considers it her greatest shame and failure that she remained under her vile master's control for so many years. Resolving never to stand by while another girl went through the same experience, she formed the Ladies of the Court. Each member of this elite squad of assassins, bodyguards, and spies were pulled from nothing as poor, abused, or lost young girls. Arming them with a purpose, she hopes to right just a few of the wrongs of the world, although whether the ideals she's put in their heads are right is questionable.

## Sirmir the Inscrutable

Sirmir has a vendetta against the Oakwest Company and the Imperial Navy because he feels they threaten the world he made a name for himself in and which he helped create. He seeks to protect freedom from control and regulations by these entities. To him, the last age of piracy and adventure represents the full potential of Esterrane, while this new age has seen those ideals encroached upon by both returning enemies of the past and old friends who have turned their backs on everything they used to hold dear.

Even within the ranks of the Council which oversees his greatest achievement, the Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole, his visions for a truly free Esterrane have been diluted by centrist voices like Madame Katherine and those who follow her. Unforgiving of this betrayal by a thousand cuts, he's allied himself with the more ruthless parties in the region, including a formidable up-and-comer: Captain Larynda Abbylan. He plans to take back what he can of the Council's voice by giving Larynda a seat, but perhaps more radical action is required to steer his Council and his Esterrane back on track.

Sirmir was born and raised on ships, only rarely spending extended periods of time on dry land until he was an adult. He worked on his father's shipping vessel as it traveled up and down the Sword Coast and occasionally making the long haul to Krynn and other exotic ports. Sirmir's father was a good man and a skilled sailor in his own right, but meek and yielding in the face of danger. Once or twice their ship would be stopped by marauders waiting patiently in remote waters for unsuspecting victims. Without weapons or skilled fighters, they would have no choice but to allow their goods to be stolen, often resulting in months of hunger as they worked to gain back the money they had lost.

Sirmir saw his captain, his father, as weak and more importantly weak-willed. The marauders they were bested by were small outfits of hungry, homeless urchins, but they possessed the resolve necessary to take what they wanted. One day while docked in port, Sirmir returned to the ship with a crew of his own, recruited from taverns and gambling dens. If his father did not have the strength to keep what he had, Sirmir would not follow in his footsteps, he would take what he wanted. Stranding his father in a strange and remote port town, young Captain Sirmir and his crew made way for Esterrane from whence they had heard tales of daring and ruthless pirate lords who were everything that his father was not and that he wanted to be.

Over the course of the next decade, he would make a name for himself running contraband goods and wanted fugitives up and down Esterrane's [[The crescent|crescent]], evading the admirals and pirate hunters of the Imperial Navy at every turn. This was the golden age of piracy in the region, culminating in the revolution in Midmark and the total defeat of the Waris Empire in Esterrane.

Sirmir does have a negative attachment with the Oakwest Company. The Company was founded by his fellow pirates in a time of oppression by the Imperial Navy. During this time, before both the revolution in Midmark and the arrival of the Minotaurs of Krynn, Waris held complete control of the region and what few pirate captains operated in Esterrane's waters were at war: hunted and killed for their insurrection. Supportive of the revolt but uninterested in seizing political power through control of Midmark instead of taking the fight to the Empire, he would be left behind by his compatriots whose ideals would morph into something Sirmir no longer recognized.

After a century of rule, the Oakwest Company has become a corporation content on using Midmark for its position as a key port city. Though it still stands for the rights and freedoms of its citizens, it has bent to allow only piracy in the form of privateering for its own selfish needs. Now that the Imperial Navy has returned, the Company has even reformed a political relationship with its former oppressors for the power and influence the two can foster together. Sirmir, outraged by this betrayal, sees only two oppressive entities in different forms: one an empire and the other a corporation.

Andthus isn't the only one set on keeping his family connections a secret. Disgraced by his youngest son and his decision to turn his back on his family's legacy, Sirmir has disowned Andthus and their relation. Only a few in Thieves' Hole will remember the young boy in Sirmir's care, who then disappeared while still just a child. Perhaps the greatest indignity of all is that his son has instead joined the crew of the Storm Raider under the leadership of  that fool, that tool of the Oakwest Company, Captain Grimlock Stormbrow.

As one of the great Pirate Lords of the last age and one of the founders of the Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole, Sirmir considers himself as one of the fathers of modern Esterrane and as responsible for her future. From his perspective it was on his watch that the Oakwest Company, at first a glorious revolution of the people and an agent of freedom in the region, was perverted into the oppressive corporation it has become. That, combined with the recent return of the Waris Empire to Warwood, reminds Sirmir almost of the time before his great deeds that he felt changed the world for the better, putting it back at square one. Without the voice of the Council on his side he feels he must do whatever it takes, however radical, to save his chosen home and return it to its former glory.

## Captain Hikaru

Pirate Lord Hikaru is sailing the waves of Esterrane instead of her own home of [Kozakura](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kozakura) in search of undiscovered treasures and historical artifacts. [Catfolk](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Catfolk_\(5e_Race\)) possess a hunger for travel and enlightenment given to them by Xalyn, a goddess of knowledge, making Esterrane a perfect adopted home. Despite her political neutrality, Captain Hikaru has allied herself with the Oakwest Company as a higher-up in the Western Isles Expansion. Along with agents of the Explorer's Society and workers from New Mithas, she now searches for new lands and ancient artifacts.

Kozakura is an archipelago nation not dissimilar to Esterrane, that lies in the region of Kara-Tur east of Faerun. This land is rife with constant political power struggles between the Shogun's government, various great families, and mutinous Daimyos.

Growing up in a large aquatic-nomadic community, sailing between and finding refuge off-shore of Kozakura's various islands, a young Hikaru learned to sail at a young age, but also to fight. Between the limited range of the Shogun's control and the economic consequences of constant political upheaval, these waters are often filled with marauders and other foes. She rose up to become one of the leaders of her little tribe at a young age, protecting her people with a stoic presence, strategic mastery, and raw combat skills.

Kozakura is home to master weaponsmiths and skilled warriors. At a young age Hikaru was trained in the arts of combat by a Hobgoblin samurai among the ranks of her clan. Even-tempered and stoic, the ways of the blade fit her nicely. She specializes in using a pair of swords: a katana and wakizashi.

Hikaru has a special connection sure her swords, Osore and Yoromeku, which she forged and enchanted herself during the culmination of her training. Osore, a katana longsword, instills fear in the hearts of men while Yoromeku, a wakizashi shortsword, cuts down cowards where they stand. Her armor, Kusshinai, is styled after samurai armor.

Her ship, Densetsu, is very inspired by her heritage but constructed here in Esterrane. It is a junk ship, sleek and fast to avoid detection, but also very heavily armored by the same materials that make up her swords and armor.

Soon after the completion of her training, Hikaru was working as a bodyguard and escort for a Daimyo of Kozakura, traveling from the Imperial Capital to a small fishing village. She found this local ruler was a cruel man, who ordered his men to slaughter the village's locals for failing to pay exorbitant taxes. Failing to save them, she instead decapitated the Daimyo and killed the rest of his men.

It was this failure that led to her life as a pirate. When the massacre of the villagers, the Daimyo, and his men was discovered the Shogun placed the blame on a single killer, an inhuman monster he named Gyakusatsu. She adopted the name and set sail, seeking revenge on other corrupt and ruthless rulers in Kozakura. After several years, with her reputation established but the authorities hot on her trail, she left for Esterrane to protect her master and her clan.

She spent the next few years charting the region's chain of islands and hitting smaller Imperial Navy vessels to punish the same types of corrupt authority figures she targeted back in Kozakura. Her unyielding strength and brazen strategy, combined with her uncontested control of the Western Isles, earned her a seat on the Council of Thieves' Hole. She is currently the newest and youngest member.

## Captain Bosnoy

Pirate Lord Bosnoy has a seat on the Council of Thieves' Hole largely as a figurehead. Bosnoy was a commanding pirate captain in the golden age of piracy, but was already significantly older than his peers. Now, bordering on senile, he resides in Thieves' Hole full time to stay available for Council meetings and to run the Recruitment Hall in town.

As a key figure in the history of Esterrane and of Thieves' Hole, he's proud of his legacy and revered by many as one of the first pirates in the region. He truly believes in the Republic's cause, but also in the freedom that Midmark has afforded its denizens. As such, he considers it his duty to remain on the Council to protect these ideals both from outside forces like the Waris Empire and from anarchist voices within like Sirmir.

Bosnoy is an elderly Loxodon over 400 years of age, one of the only people who can say they were around for the mass-migration from the plane of Ixalan. He was one of those people, crossing over through a naturally-forming portal in the arctic expanse of Esterrane's far north. Like his fellow travelers, he made his way south to Warwood where he would live in the squalid conditions of a Waris-run shanty town for the members of exotic races for nearly a year.

With this mass-immigration came a panic among the higher-ups of Warwood and the Imperial Navy, and plans to settle a new colony in the southern island of Midmark were sped up to deal with the issue. Bosnoy found himself on one of the first ships traveling south, and the port city was little more than a jungle village when he arrived. With little help or resources, the migrants had to make their own homes and catch or farm their own food. The first year was hell, with hunger and disease running rampant in the settlement, and many, like Bosnoy, set sail to rob freighters of their food and building materials.

Soon after more Waris ships would arrive with the materials and workers needed to build the burgeoning island capital from the ground up, but Bosnoy's experiences of the suffering they'd caused had already set him on his path. He continued to operate as a pirate under a mask, continuing to steal from the Navy first based out of Midmark but eventually moving to an island headquarters that would become Thieves' Hole. Here, others of his kind would flock including a young Captain Sirmir who would go on to found the Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole on the island.

## Captain Milo Fairtide

### Maphina Fairtide

Maphina grew up on ships, but was born in Thieves' Hole. Her mother died in an accident on the docks (her father believes it was the Navy's doing) so she grew up with her father on his ships. Her father is a member of the Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole. She has an older sister (Jayola Sandfoot) that didn't take to ships, who currently lives in Midmark and is married  (can't remember name) with one son (Finch, who Maphina dotes on).

Her family has a house located in Thieves' Hole which they utilize during the cold months but she is mostly found on one of her father's ships. She has traveled all over Esterrane since she was a child. She loves Midmark and their work ethic, and hates the upper-crust snobbery of the Warwood loyalists. Thieves' Hole isn't much but it's home.

She carried about 50gold on her before she was taken in but has about 200g squirreled away at home in Thieves' Hole. By trade, she is a ship's cook and sailor.

She has a particular hatred and distrust of the Imperial Navy, greatly admires the Ladies of the Court (almost trained to be one), and has pleasant relationships with the Merchants and Traders of Esterrane Guild, the Oakwest Company (her dad worked with them often) and Explorers' Society (friendly old duffers looking to keep busy). She believes it takes all types to get a job done and doesn't really give a shit about what other people look like or where they came from: unless they are loyal to the Navy.

Maphina would like to own her own fleet of ships. She would love especially to inherit her father's main ship, The Midmark Maiden, to lead her fleet but her father's first mate is trying to weasel his way into inheriting it. Overall, she is not persistently pursuing this aspiration as she believes she is too young to captain a whole fleet just yet. There's more to explore!

Maphina was once engaged to a man in Midmark but he wanted her to settle down and stay at home, so she immediately broke it off.

Maphina has been arrested due to her connection with her father's crimes. The Navy believe they can draw him out when he learns of her capture. She has never been arrested before. She has been in prison for 1 week. She managed to hide her holy symbol.
