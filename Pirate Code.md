**The Pirate Code of Thieves' Hole** is the foundation of the pirate coalition now known as the [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole]].

## History of the Pirate Code

Prior the founding of the [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole]], crews would draw-up their own ship- and crew-specific *Articles of Agreement*, which outlined strict rules and the associated disciplinary action. They primarily served to keep order aboard the ship, avoid dissension or mutinies, and ensure the crews' loyalty, all of which was crucial to the group's mutual survival.

A prevalent theme across the Articles of multiple crews was that there no official hierarchy, meaning the Captain’s authority was not absolute. While the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] painted the pirates as barbarous anarchists, the drafting of Articles of Agreement and the equal votes afforded to each crew member meant many facets of life as a pirate was more fair and democratic than life under naval command.

Most often, it was the [[Bosun]] who was responsible for interpreting the Articles, and decisions were called by the Captain and required a majority vote by the crew. The Articles were considered to be legally binding, and there were swift and severe consequences for those that broke them. Failing to honor the Articles could get a pirate marooned, whipped, beaten, or even executed.

## Tenets of the Code

1. That every one, so long as they obey civil command, has a vote in affairs of moment.
2. That the fund of all payments is the stock of what is gotten by the expedition, following the same law as other pirates. That is, *No purchase, no pay*.
3. That every one shall have equal title to the fresh provisions, or strong liquors, at any time seized, and may use them at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing among them) makes it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a retrenchment.
4. That none shall engage in cowardice or desert their crew in times of engagement.
5. That none shall defraud the company to the value of a piece of silver in plate, jewels, or money.
6. That a standard compensation is provided out of the public stock for maimed and mutilated buccaneers. Any who should lose a limb is to have six pieces of gold, and for lesser hurts, proportionately.
7. That every person who shall offend against any of these articles shall be punished with death or marooning, or in such other manner as the [[Captain]] and the majority of the company shall think proper.

### The Common Rights

1. That good quarters are to be given to any aboard when craved.
2. That none shall offer to meddle with a prudent woman, without her consent.
3. That any who are to be marooned shall be afforded one bottle of smokepowder, one bottle of water, one small  arm, and shot.
