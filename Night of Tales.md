The Night of Tales is an annual celebration of Esterrane's history, its heroes and villains, and the place in it that the people of Midmark have managed to carve out for themselves. On this night the city erupts with festivities. Shops and taverns offer discounts on their goods and services, people gather in the streets for caroling and trick or treating, and of course most of the city dresses up in colorful costumes.

The holiday started as a way of celebrating the liberation of Midmark from the Waris Empire, with people dressing up both as Imperial Navy officers and revolutionary pirates. It quickly evolved into a much broader celebration of Esterrane's history and the histories of everyone who made their homes here. As such, it's common to see costumes of well-known heroes and villains from other regions around the world, or even just casual costuming in general.
