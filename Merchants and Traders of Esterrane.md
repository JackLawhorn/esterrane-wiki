Formed during the most lawless of periods for the region, the Merchants and Traders of Esterrane Guild acts as a union for shop- and innkeepers, blacksmiths, ship builders, and many other classes of working class citizens. Membership offers protection from theft and fraud by banning offenders from most establishments. The Guild even employs licensed privateers that will pursue repeat offenders and repossess stolen value (and more) by any means necessary.
