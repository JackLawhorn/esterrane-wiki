Just as their eager curiosity drew them to the ships of the Brazen Coalition in their homeland of Ixalan, goblins have thrived as pirates in the land of Esterrane. Though still partial to remote jungles, goblins are most commonly seen swinging on the ropes of sleek pirate ships.

Goblins often stick to groups of other members of their race as a result of general prejudice against them and a preference towards speaking Goblin as opposed to Common.

## Proficient Crewmen

Goblins stand about three feet tall, though they rarely stand upright. They prefer a crouched posture that lets them scramble quickly on all fours, aided by their long prehensile tails. Their hearing and eyesight make them excellent lookouts, and their agility serves them well as crew members on pirate ships. They climb, swing, and jump easily among a ship’s ropes, and can get into tight spaces that humans can’t.

## Lesser Creatures

Goblins are often considered lesser than their neighbors and fellow crewmen as a result of their more animalistic nature. Still, they serve as a bountiful source of labor for captains to take advantage of. As such, they are traditionally paid less and typically take on less attractive positions if not those they are naturally adept at such as scout.

## Practical Jokers

For better or worse, many goblins are also incorrigible pranksters, and they often have a hard time determining when a prank is inappropriate, is poorly timed, or has gone too far.

## Unrelenting Gossips

Coupled with others of their race, goblins become terrible gossips. It's common to see gaggles of gossiping goblins at bars or walking the streets of port towns. The urge to act like this is so powerful that they'll often divulge dangerous secrets or insult someone standing nearby, often risking serious repercussions.
