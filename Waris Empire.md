## The Long War
- The Long War was a century long conflict wherein several Waris colonies, led by Basinhelm, banded together in revolution and successfully defended their lands for decades. In the end several of these revolutionary territories fell and remained under the Empire's control, but the remainder gained their independence when Waris became concerned that its military forces would be so weakened that it might be challenged at home by neighboring kingdoms.
- The conflict severely weakened the Empire, especially in Esterrane which was rapidly becoming their most prized colony. The naval forces were called back for the war effort, leaving the region to pirates and spiteful members of oppressed races. Though the Oakwest Company's uprising was not a part of Basinhelm's revolution, the timing was certainly optimal.
- Waris's presence in Esterrane today is extremely limited. With only one city under their control, a handful of naval ships, and a general unease at the idea of entering another conflict, it's unlikely that they will try to regain control of Midmark any time soon.

## Race & Discrimination
- The Waris Empire is very much an old fashion kind of society. When they first "discovered" Esterrane, much of the world's general attitude was that some races were more acceptable and less animalistic or monstrous that others. For Waris this largely meant more traditional fantasy races like Humans, Dwarves, and Elves were seen as a class above others like Tieflings, Half-Orcs, and Dragonborn. The Triton natives of Esterrane were accepted into Warwood society both for being closer to the acceptable races and for the possibility of exploiting them and their history.
- When races from Ixalan came through to our world, the Empire's attitude towards them was very different and the colony expanded south to Midmark in an attempt to keep them out of the capital. Those who stayed were made to live in slums, persecuted by many of the loyal Waris colonists, and often unjustly imprisoned or even executed. The exact conditions endured by these races during this time period are largely undocumented, luckily for the Empire.
- One significant and (somewhat) documented event is the Rak-Ta Massacre, perpetrated against a large group of Lizardfolk refugees seeking asylum in the region. Failing to establish a settlement of their own in the Southeastern Rim, they came to Warwood looking for aid. They were allowed to establish what was essentially a shanty town, but were constantly antagonized by the citizens who had to be held off by guards. After a Lizardfolk refugee was accused of butchering one such citizen, the guards turned their blades and firearms on the entire group. The few who survived were imprisoned, but little else is known about their fate.
- The aforementioned attempt to move these races to Midmark would end up backfiring as the Southern Rim's natural resources and access to trade routes were so beneficial to Waris that the capital was also moved there. The monstrous races were not treated as harshly here but racial districts were enforced to keep them in line and to ensure the safety of natural-born Waris citizens. Of course many laws were still enforced more often against some races than not. The names of many unjustly executed Midmarkers are etched into a memorial wall in the Oakwest Company's Headquarters in The Hub.
- When the Empire was forced to send most of their naval units from Esterrane back to fight in the Long War, an existing circle of pirates managed to incite rebellion in Midmark. During this period many of the Waris officials remaining were either jailed or executed and these pirates were able to seize control for all oppressed peoples in the region. This group would eventually be reformed as a shipping empire and renamed The Oakwest Company in an attempt to gain credibility in both politics and business.
- The Empire and those loyal to it are now confined to Warwood in the North, although their loyalty has been tested by decades of rule by an absent government. Although both the Empire and its colonists still hold many racial biases, these have largely been toned down and today many more races are accepted in Warwood. Others still face discrimination and systematic oppression, which has kept them out for the most part.
