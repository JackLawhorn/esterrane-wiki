  - "[[Ladies of the Court]]"

The Ladies of the Court hide in plain sight – entrenched in [[Esterrane|Esterranean]] society by means of their legitimate business practices – though commissioning their other services is not as straightforward. Their guild trades in secrets and leverage, and a simple inquiry often gives away more than one expects. Moreover, they retain the right to deny service at any time and without justification. Perhaps the request would bring too much trouble, or perhaps the job's target pays more for their protection already than what was offered.

## Contacting the Ladies of the Court

## Services Offered

### Protection, Sanctuary, & Safe Passage

For a relatively small price, one might secure guaranteed shelter, safe passage, or even personal protection from the Ladies of the Court. Few are brazen enough to pursue a target – no matter how valuable – known to have been given sanctuary by the Ladies. It is even said that a wanted fugitive under the protection of the Ladies of the Court could walk up [[Revolutionary Way]] in downtown [[Midmark]] without any harm coming to them.

Magically obscured hideaways within the halls of guild bordellos in every major port city provide the perfect getaway from scorned rivals, keen bounty hunters, and even major players like the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] or Midmark's [[Company Men]]. When traveling between ports, one might be better off stowed away in the brig of a guild pleasure vessel – which are often exempt from or overlooked during [[port inspections]] – than at the helm of their own ship.

### Intelligence & Access

In Esterrane, knowing the right information or having the right access can make the difference between freedom, life in prison, or a lonely grave at the bottom of the sea. With agents everywhere and influence at all levels of every faction, the Ladies of the Court are well-equipped to trade in well-guarded secrets and access to the most secure of places.

The Ladies make a habit of cataloguing the proclivities of their clients, familiarizing themselves with the names and shifts of the help, and knowing the comings and goings of the key players in the region. Though they may not help themselves to the contents of every safe and stashbox in the guards quarters and [[Governor's Mansions]], you can be sure that they know the combination or are have a copy of the key.

### Procurement & Assassination

For those clients whose needs require a more direct approach, the Ladies of the Court also serve as master thieves and assassins.
