## Sovereignty of Aegae Rock

- [[Triton History Reconstruction Museum]] possesses one of only two original copies of the [[Triton-Minotauran Treaty]] which ensured complete ownership and autonomy of this last refuge, in exchange for the [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotaurs]]' rights to expand into what little unsettled territory remained: the [[Western Isles]].
- The document outlines the exact geographic boundaries of the neighborhood and specifies that Triton Town citizens are subject to the laws of their own council rather than those of the rest of New Mithas, so long as no actions against the latter cross over into New Mithas proper. The only addendum yet to be added to the Treaty hangs here as well, extending the verbiage to remove Triton Town from the jurisdiction of a new law enforcement organization: the Gun Witches.
- Perhaps the most controversial verbiage is centered around trade and business. This section reads: "The Minotauran people of the great city of New Mithas shall not impede the economic security of our most respected neighbors, the Tritons of Triton Town, by introducing unwelcome competition across territory lines in any trade or industry, and vice versa." This serves to protect the Tritons from unnecessary economic pressure from their neighbors, but has also enforced a ceiling to their economic growth by giving the Minotaurs veto power over Triton business outside of this ten-block radius.
- Respected leaders on both sides of the agreement signed this document and her sister, currently hanging in the Minotauran Council headquarters, in blood
