## Indigenous Triton art
- This section houses a modest collection of ancient Triton artwork, as well as the world's largest collection of pre-colonial tribal Triton artwork you'll ever find.
- Segments of walls adorned with colorful mosaics, pristinely removed from their place in Triton ruins and displayed upon several rows of pedestals. These portray a number of different battle scenes, pantheonic images, maps of the region and the stars above, portraits of heroes, etc.
- Statues, some recovered from island ruins and some found underwater in various states of disarray, portray Triton heroes and sea creatures alike. Tritons are well known to have had meaningful relationships with hippocampi, giant sea horses, and sea lions, so much so that they could be beckoned by blowing on conch shells. You'll definitely see life-size depictions of these and other fauna. Investigation -->
- Among the various heroes depicted, you'll recognize the subjects of one from a surprising source. In one statue, you'll see what appear to be two Triton knights, mounting giant sea horses and brandishing ornately engraved lances. You'll definitely recognize them as Belthyn and Nalos of the Planinauts, your two slain prisoners.
- From there, the artifacts shift forward to after the mysterious cataclysm that befell the Tritons of Esterrane
- First up is traditional tribal clothing and jewelry. Tritons began using more traditional clothe materials which you'll see used mainly in robes and more flowy articles of clothing. Esterrane's tropical climate means there a good amount of flora from which the many tribes of the region extracted a wide variety of vibrant dyes which are reflected in the clothes you'll see here.
- Wood-, stone-, and bone-carved trinkets, many of them portraying creatures populating the coasts the tribes called home, as well as the surrounding waters. You'll also see holy symbols and maybe even some early sets of dice. One segment collects rectangular tablets displaying cave-painting-style designs.
