## Immigrant Deities

- AKA "interloper" deities
- The distinction is largely meaningless, outside of obscure theological debates, for there is absolutely no difference from the perspective of the mortal races of Toril.
- Worshiped on other worlds and on other planes before their followers entered Toril via portals and other means.

## Dead Deities

> The constant clash of deities also ensures a steady supply of dead deities whose temples now lie in ruin about Toril. Moreover, death doesn’t necessarily end the career of a deity of Toril. The possibility of resurrection always exists, as evidenced by the recent return of Bane. Small cults dedicated to the resurrection of one lost deity or another appear everywhere in Faerûn. Sometimes the deity is beyond the reach of such cultists or never existed except in myth, and its adherents receive no divine backing in their endeavors. Other times, a dead deity retains enough power to provide divine backing to a handful of worshipers. Occasionally, another deity masquerades in the guise of a dead deity, in hopes of expanding its portfolio. Some dead human deities who retain a handful of adherents include Amaunator (a Netherese sun god), Bhaal (the former deity of murder), Ibrandul (a deity of caverns slain by Shar during the Time of Troubles), Moander (a deity of corruption slain by Finder Wyvernspur), and Myrkul (former god of death whose remaining essence infuses an artifact called the Crown of Horns)

### Talos

### Umberlee

### Auril

## Deities of Knowledge & Invention

### Oghma

- **Alignment:** Neutral
- **Portfolio:** Bards, inspiration, invention, knowledge
- **Worshipers:** Artists, bards, cartographers, inventors, loremasters, sages, scholars, scribes, wizards
- Radical deities like [[#Lathander]] and [[#Lliira]] who oppose the status quo are often at odds with him

- Daily *Cornerstones of the Day*
	- The Binding: morning ceremony of writing mystic symbols during silent prayer
	- The Covenant: evening ritual sharing works of wisdom, song, and new knowledge
- Holy days of *Midsummer* and *Shieldmeet*, which traditionally mark new agreements or pacts
- When a child follower reaches the age of 12 (or non-human equivalent), local clerics perform a Naming ceremony where they receive their *True Name*
	- Mostly just used for personal prayer, but there is superstition about sharing it and the power it has

>[!quote] Not long after Shar and Selûne created Toril and gave birth to Chauntea, the world's animating spirit, a traveler ventured to the world from a distant realm. He came upon a chaotic landscape of indistinct, shapeless concepts yearning to be given solidarity. To each of these concepts he gave a name that would define it in the aeons to come. Such was the power of these names that the concepts transcended their elusive existence, bound to physical form in the material world. Thus, did Oghma, the Binder of What is Known, give order to chaos and claim an honored place among Toril's oldest deities.

	- They are under orders to donate 25% of their monetary income to the church, to invest in all enterprises that have any reasonable hope of succeeding if they are run by devout worshippers, and to consider other investments if approached by entrepreneurs willing to make substantial offerings to the deity.
	- They are not above manipulating trade by means of rumors, buy-ups, hired border brigands, and the like. The church officially denies any of the above due to strong public criticism in the past.
	- They are lavishly dressed in rich robes, gaudy and ornate ritual garb, with white silk undergarments, slashed and fluted sleeves and boots, pince-nez and lorgnettes  (if they have any weakness of vision); various useful items dangling from silk ribbons, and tall gilded and gem-covered miters. All covered by a gilded scarlet cloak heavy with the weight of thousands of wheels, plates, clasps, and flourishes of various precious metals. Finished off with white gloves and a gilded rod or staff carved and set with gems.
- Temples are often ornately decorated and constructed with the finest materials with no expense spared. Decorations cover the floors, walls, roof pillars, and even ceilings if possible. These elements are baroque, intricate, brightly colored, and feature as much previous metal and gemstones as can be fitted into the design.
	- Despite these aesthetics, temples are often impregnable fortresses in defense of the great wealth held inside
