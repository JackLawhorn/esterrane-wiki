Founded during the time of Waris rule in Esterrane, Thieves' Hole is a haven for thieves, pirates, and forgers alike. With the Oakwest Company in power, the roguish criminals of Esterrane have little to fear around Midmark or New Mithas, but Thieves' Hole offers a safe getaway closer to Warwood where people are still loyal to the Empire. The small town is hidden behind dangerously rocky waters, narrow channel-ways and a guardian water elemental, but any seasoned pirate captain in the region could navigate there with their eyes closed.

If Midmark is a vibrant reflection of Esterrane's free-spirit and exotic love of adventure, Thieves' Hole is a shadier, lawless place where individual freedom is taken to the extreme. Residents and visitors range from charming master thieves and charismatic pirate captains, to cruel villains and bloodthirsty murderers. With peace maintained by the fragile bond of an "honor among thieves" mentality, fights and robberies aren't uncommon but most are dissuaded by the unlikelihood of getting away with the crime (or even their life). If you can look past the grimy aspects of this place, you might come to find that it is a hidden gem in Esterrane.

Built hastily and without much expertise on previously uninhabited land, Thieves' Hole is a rickety multi-layered network of creaky wooden walkways and ramshackle structures. Expanding both outward further into the island and upward atop existing structures, the town is small but dense. A minute's walk can take you past several typical social hubs like taverns, fight clubs, and gambling halls. The town is also home to some out of the ordinary options like the Ladies of the Court guild hall, the Enemies of Esterrane bounty board, and the Recruitment Hall.
