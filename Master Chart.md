The **Master Chart** is a powerful magical instrument developed over half a century of collaboration between the [[Oakwest Company]] and the [[Explorers Society#Explorers Society of Midmark|Explorers Society of Midmark]]. Its form is that of a massive, detailed chart of the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]] which sits on display in the Company's headquarters in [[Midmark]] and is continuously updated by Society cartographers.

Navigators throughout the region carry charts of their own which are enchanted to reflect the latest updates to the Master in real time. In turn, they are encouraged to report new discoveries to the Society for a reasonable commission upon verification.
