**The Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole** serves as a unifying body and representative voice for all of [[Esterrane]]'s thieves, criminals, and rogues. Founded during [[Waris Colonization]] by the region's few scrappy pirates, this rag-tag coalition represented the first significant movement of opposition to the [[Waris Imperial Navy|Imperial Navy]]'s rule and later successfully brought it to an end by orchestrating the [[Midmark Revolution]].

After the Revolution, some pursued newfound legitimate business opportunities and founded the now ubiquitous [[Oakwest Company]]. Those who stayed in Thieves' Hole – the truly ungovernable rebels of the Republic – enjoyed decades of diminished navy presence and a great deal of goodwill from the liberated peoples of Midmark, colloquially known as the *[[People's Pardon]]*.

## The Isle of Thieves' Hole

Established on a small but dense [[Thieves' Hole|Isle of Thieves' Hole]] in the [[Lawless East]], the Republic has survived nearly two centuries largely thanks to the labyrinthine and treacherous geography of [[Esterrane]]'s densest island chains. Despite active pursuit by the pirate hunters of the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] and repeated [[Explorers Society]] expeditions, the location of the hidden stronghold is a closely kept secret to this day.

The isle itself is tiny and dominated by lush, untamed jungle, very little of which is charted much less inhabited. The Republic's foundation sits immediately inland of a secluded bay accessible only by narrow, winding waterways. Without a proper port, sailing ships anchor in this naturally-occurring harbor and crews ferry themselves to land.

The only permanent structures here are two large temples – to [[Gods & Deities#Mask|Mask, Master of All Thieves]] and [[Gods & Deities#Shar|Shar, Mistress of the Night]] respectively – and the moored vessels making up [[Thieves' Hole#Flagship Alley|Flagship Alley]], around which an ever growing and multi-layered shanty town has been constructed. Structures haphazardly built by generations of pirates loosely form a number of overlapping districts, but the town's layout seems to change significantly with every visit.

## Pirate Lords of Esterrane

The [[Pirate Lords]] are a council of established captains old and new, tasked with governing what few rules and regulations keep the Republic together. Though the method of attaining this high station and the discussions being had within the council's meeting chambers are kept just as much of a secret to outsiders as the location of [[Thieves' Hole]] itself, they claim to speak for and represent the interest of all of [[Esterrane]]'s pirates in a kind of libertarian anocracy.

The first Pirate Lords came together at the founding of the Republic to steward the coalition and ensure enforcement of the newly defined [[Pirate Code]]. These great rogues and adventurers of their time garnered widespread support from their contemporaries for daring raids against the vessels of the [[Waris Imperial Navy]]. Nearly two centuries later, their influence lives on not only through the tenets of the Code but also their ships which – moored together – form the center of power in Thieves' Hole: [[Thieves' Hole#Flagship Alley|Flagship Alley]].

Today's Pirate Lords face unprecedented internal conflict and a threat not seen in a century: the returned navy of the [[Waris Empire]]. By seniority, they are [[Mender Bosnoy the Modest]], [[Captain Sirmir the Inscrutable]], [[Captain Milo Fairtide the Treacly]], and [[Warchief Rhedred the Battlehearted]].

## Politics of Thieves' Hole

Despite it's name, political scholars consider the "Republic" a kind of libertarian anocracy run much like a ship's crew as defined by the [[Pirate Code]]: where "every individual has a vote in affairs of the moment," but command ultimately falls to the often ruthless council of [[Pirate Lords]]. To outsiders, the mechanisms of power here are opaque and mysterious. The Pirate Lords seem to depend on both internal support and the notoriety given to them by external authority. Both are cultivated through daring acts of theft and piracy, raids against naval or merchant ships, and victory in battles against great odds.

Few formal laws are in place to govern the people, save for the [[Pirate Code#Tenets of the Code|tenets]] of the [[Pirate Code]], and the council ensures that the spirit of the Code is upheld by all denizens of the Republic. Gross violations are punished "with death, marooning, or in such other manner as the \[Pirate Lords\] and the majority of the \[Republic\] shall think proper." Some of the articles have historically been enforced with more leeway than others, but others – especially the [[Pirate Code#The Common Rights|Common Rights]] – see much stricter enforcement

Internally, politics of the Republic are primarily defined by a single issue which divides the Pirate Lords and their supporters into two distinct parties: that issue being the longstanding status quo in [[Esterrane]] as defined by the century-long absence of the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] and peace between the Republic and the [[Oakwest Company]]. The more radical, anarchist pirates of [[Thieves' Hole]] – led by [[Captain Sirmir the Inscrutable]] and [[Warchief Rhedred the Battlehearted]] – dream of seeing renewed conflict so that they may sate their chaotic and often bloodthirsty nature. Their more levelheaded colleagues – [[Mender Bosnoy the Modest]] and [[Captain Milo Fairtide the Treacly]] – consider this peace to be the great achievement of their tenure and a stable relationship with the Company key to the continued survival of the Republic.

## Patron Deities

The most well known of the Republic's patron deities is [[Gods & Deities#Mask|Mask, Master of All Thieves]], whose holy symbol graces their flag. Secondarily, [[Gods & Deities#Shar|Shar, Mistress of the Night]] – whose portfolio includes all secrets – is also closely associated with [[Thieves' Hole]] for the elusiveness of its exact location. The island stronghold itself has been built up around two large templates to these patrons in particular.

The pirates of Thieves' Hole share several patron deities in common with any other class of seafaring adventurer that can be found in the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]]. It is not uncommon to find pirate crews worshipping [[Gods & Deities#Tymora|Tymora, the Lady Who Smiles]] for good fortune, or to [[Gods & Deities#Shaundakul|Shaundakul, Rider of the Winds]] or to [[Gods & Deities#Valkur|Valkur, Captain of the Waves]] for favorable winds. Because pirate vessels are more likely than most to find themselves in naval combat encounters, the gods of combat, battle, and war also see much patronage. Those more even-keeled adventurers who rely on strategy and tactics to find victory in naval combat may pray to Valkur, [[Gods & Deities#Tempus|Tempus, Lord of Battles]], or the [[Gods & Deities#Red Knight|Red Knight, Lady of Strategy]]. Conversely, the more radical pirates empowered by their own fury and bloodlust find inspiration in the dogma of [[Gods & Deities#Garagos|Garagos, the Reaver]].

Some in the Republic – especially the old guard and those inspired by the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] in Esterrane – lean towards the dramatic and fly the colors of deities they know will strike fear into the hearts of their enemies. [[Pirate Lords|Pirate Lord]] [[Sirmir the Inscrutable]] has long purported to be a fervent follower of [[Gods & Deities#Bane|Bane, the Black Hand]], though many think this is simply theatrics from the old Tiefling. Others claim the favor of Garagos, [[Gods & Deities#Gargauth|Gargauth, the Hidden Lord]] or [[Gods & Deities#Talos|Talos, the Storm Lord]] for the image of destruction they conjure.

## Allies & Enemies

The Republic has staunchly remained an insular coalition of pirates, thieves, criminals, and rogues and as such have not curried favor with many allies. Even their relationship with the [[Oakwest Company]], which sprang from their own ranks after the [[Midmark Revolution]], is strained due to ideological differences and repeated raids on merchant vessels. Their greatest alliance to date has been with [[Madame Katherine]] and her [[Ladies of the Court]], whose connections have helped to sustain good favor with the people of [[Midmark]] and a kind of sustained peacetime with the Company.

Since the Republic's founding, their greatest enemy has always been the [[Waris Imperial Navy]]. The hidden stronghold of Thieves' Hole provides the sole respite from the navy's pirate hunters who to this day patrol the dense island chains of the [[Lawless East]] searching for fugitives to capture or kill.

This constant pursuit has made the Republic even more paranoid of intruders by outside factions, resulting in attacks against several [[Explorers Society]] expeditions attempting to chart this subregion. Despite Madame Katherine's best efforts, this has led to strained relations with the Society as well.

The Republic has also managed to form a kind of alliance with the [[Goblins of Esterrane|Goblin]] clans of the Lawless east. Both parties benefit from keeping outsiders out of these treacherous waters, and the Goblins are well known to feel at home bouncing from ship to ship serving mostly menial roles as riggers and gunners – often referred to as *powder monkeys*.

## Rumors & Mysteries

The Republic's strange relationship with the [[Oakwest Company]] – whose founders were pirates of [[Thieves' Hole]] themselves – is often fodder for suspicions and theories of a vast conspiracy. While the Company's import/export business with far away lands to the east and west is largely legitimate, pirate raids on the merchant vessels of their clients have grown increasingly rare over the last decades. Some claim a kind of symbiotic relationship between the two related factions by which the threat of raids is used as a cudgel to force travelling merchants into paying the Company for protection in a kind of large-scale protection racket.

Those already suspicious of [[Madame Katherine]] and her [[Ladies of the Court]] have long claimed that the matriarch's near 70-year relationship with the pirates of Thieves' Hole is far deeper than it may seem. Her key role in maintaining a sustained peace with the Company and frequent eye witness accounts of her vessel – *[[the Court's Whisper]]* – venturing into the treacherous waters of the [[Lawless East]] have even led some to speculate that she serves as a kind of honorary [[Pirate Lords|Pirate Lord]].
