- Can be found in the [[Lawless East]]
- Gargantuan mimic posing as a ghost ship
	- Possibly acts as a shell for some other creature, probably one with tentacles
- Ship dead in the water, appears at night
- When on the top deck, the party sees lantern light coming from below decks and begins to hear what sounds like footsteps
	- High enough passive perception and you can tell there's something unnatural about the footsteps noise
