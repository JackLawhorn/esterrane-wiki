### Founding of the Warwood Chapter

In the first years and decades after the [[founding of warwood|founding]] of [[Warwood]], the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] carried out several exploratory expeditions north towards [[Brittle Maiden's Reach]] and south into what is now called the [[Lawless East]]. When they returned, they brought with them mysterious artifacts, first- and secondhand accounts of exotic creatures and strange magics, and – best of all – trophies that could be brought back to the young colony.

The [[Explorers Society of Warwood]] was founded as an exclusive gentlemen's club for those brave souls undertaking these expeditions, as well as for the wealthy patrons financing them. Though unaffiliated with the navy, its membership was primarily comprised of celebrated admirals, some particularly well-connected officers, and only the wealthiest of civilians – mostly independently wealthy cartographical hobbyists, scientific researchers, and other academics.

The exploits of the [[Explorers Society of Warwood]] played a significant role in drawing newcomers to the [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]]. Naval officers from the [[Waris Empire|Waris homeland]] came to regard the [[Colony of Warwood]] as a prized post where one might find wealth, acclaim, and career prospects galore. Others, both from the Empire and abroad, would make the pilgrimage to Warwood seeking the opportunities of colonial life or hoping to strike out on their own elsewhere in the region – many in the latter group are now considered among the first [[Pirates of Esterrane]].

Over the course of its first century, much of the Society's efforts were sadly preoccupied with plundering [[Esterrane]] and extracting what value there was to take. Its greatest accomplishment remains the initial charting of the region.

### Founding of the Midmark Chapter

When the [[Waris Imperial Navy]] first made its way south to what is now the [[Midmark|City of Midmark]] and put down roots there, its ships carried with them no less than two dozen members of the Explorers Society. A new Chapter situated on [[Esterrane]]'s [[Southern Rim]] would not only bring greater access to the uncharted island chains in what is now the [[Lawless East]], but would also allow expeditions into the [[Western Isles]].

The indigenous [[Tritons|Tritons]] that called this island home represented great opportunity themselves. There was much to learn about Triton language and culture, and of course the ever-mysterious issue of [[their people's lost history]].

### Delving into the Triton ruins

Though 

Because the majority of Triton ruins are under the sea, explorers are limited to those that have resurfaced after hundreds of years of changing sea levels. Only a handful had been discovered until five years ago when one of the younger up-and-coming members, [[Aymar Qiris]] stumbled upon a new discovery in the [[Western Isles]]. This discovery played a crucial role in the Western Isles Expansion deal between Midmark and New Mithas and landed him the lead role in this endeavor where he's made a number of other major discoveries.

Some of these ruins are still being explored, but many technological artifacts and works of art have been found. Most of these ancient technologies are no longer operational but are being examined at Explorer's Society Headquarters.

### The Western Isles Expansion

Today, many islands have not been thoroughly explored, most have been named and had their shores charted.

Only in the last decade, with the recent migration of [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotauran]] refugees from the west and their founding of [[New Mithas]], has a new opportunity has kindled a new influx in membership and interest. In collaboration with the Oakwest Company, these settlers began taming large swaths of the [[Western Isles]] sub-region at an unprecedented rate in a massive project known as the [[Western Isles Expansion]]. This project was largely ignored by the Society, who's remaining membership was not too motivated to work with the Minotauran workers – themselves not too curious about historical artifacts and less than cautious in their work – until a string of significant discoveries across this frontier and Esterrane's [[Southern Rim]] by younger upstart [[Aymar Qiris]].

The Elven archaeologist found what appeared to be a number of [[Triton ruins]] that had appeared where none had existed just weeks prior. Moreover, previously discovered ruins and artifacts showed evidence of some arcane awakening during that same period, imbued with new magics and life for the first time in centuries. For the first time in decades, all of Esterrane was rushing at once to seize the power and opportunity these discoveries represented. Likewise, Qiris has leveraged this newfound interest to unite his more liberally-minded colleagues in the founding of the [[Explorers Society Western Isles Chapter]].
