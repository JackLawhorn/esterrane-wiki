The Moon Hills are a rugged series of steep hills at the heart of Nentir Vale. Patrols from Fallcrest help keep the area’s organized threats in check, but monsters often make forays out from the Cloak Wood. Strange creatures drawn from the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the Elemental Plane of Earth are also found here.

## Welcome to {{title}}



## Ambient Mood

The hills are steep and sharp, with jagged escarpments forming sprawling, hilly plateaus. Small groves dot the area, as do the occasional burial mound, watchtowers from ancient Saruun Khel, and other old ruins. The features of the Moon Hills include the following:

- Play up the hills and the jagged cliff faces, making travel through this area feel like navigating a maze. Straight and easy paths are rare here.
- Random boulders are common in the area, placed by the influence of elemental earth and looking as though they were dropped from the sky. Wind and rain erode the soil to reveal other strange rock formations that develop as elemental earth energy seeps into the landscape.
- The area’s key hook is the presence of many crossings to the Feywild and the Shadowfell. The minotaurs of Saruun Khel traveled to both those planes and the Plane of Earth to trade. The distorted topography of the Moon Hills is due in part to the influence of earth magic, and areas near planar crossings exhibit otherworldly traits. This doesn’t always imply the presence of monsters, but it can leave travelers feeling unsettled.
- Plenty of farms and manor houses are found in the area, owing to its proximity to Fallcrest. Trails, old fences of wood or stone, property markers, and so on are common sights, especially near the roads and the river.
- Several druids are active in the area, drawn by the ambient planar energy and its effects on the land. Though rocky, the soil of the Moon Hills is bountiful, in part because of the links to the Feywild and the Plane of Earth. Though in some areas, the influence of the Shadowfell renders the land gray and dull.
- The maze-like nature of this land promises lots of hidden areas and sudden discoveries. When bandits are active here, they thrive on ambush.
- The variety of terrain and features makes travel in the Moon Hills challenging. Any experienced traveler can attempt to navigate this place, but the lack of clear sight lines and the difficulty of long-distance navigation can make things daunting for the inexperienced.

## Settlements

An attack on any of the farms or manors in the Moon Hills draws the notice of travelers or locals within a day or two. While the area has its secrets, the countryside is civilized overall.

## Ruins and Dungeons

The area is dotted with a few basic types of ruins and dungeons, including the following:

- Megaliths have been raised by the druids, with tunnels and chambers excavated beneath them. They are constructed at points where planar energy is strongest, putting many in proximity with ancient ruins of Saruun Khel.
- Ruined watchtowers and small forts built by the Saruun minotaurs dot the landscape. Humanoid monsters use them as temporary bases.
- A few abandoned farmhouses and manors are found in the hills. These are the legacy of raids that took place when this area was not so well protected by Fallcrest.
- Undiscovered vaults of Saruun Khel are still hidden in the Moon Hills.
- An earth cult might establish a hidden base in the area.

## Exploration

Wracked by energy from the Plane of Earth and dotted with crossings to the Feywild and the Shadowfell, the Moon Hills can be difficult to navigate away from the safety of Fallcrest and its immediate environs. The hills form a confusing mess of paths between their steep slopes.

Navigation. The steep hills and the winding paths between them can be confusing, but the sparse vegetation of the hills allows clear views of the sky. If the characters are off the roads or paths that wind through this area, they must always navigate to avoid becoming lost—even if their destination does not normally require a check. In that case, the check DC is 10.

Foraging. DC 10; water and light game are plentiful.

Special Rules. If the characters take a long rest here, roll on the planar confluence table.

### Navigation

If the characters are seeking a specific location, use the DCs on the table. Characters who become lost must make a check to navigate to a destination, even if they have a map or know the path from having made a prior visit.

| DC   | Location                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| None | Fallcrest                      |

| 25   | Pits of the Fang               |
| 30   | Lost gate of the Laughing Path |

### Planar Confluence

Parties that rest in the Moon Hills risk exposure to planar magic. Whenever the characters complete a long rest here, roll a d20 and consult the table.

| D20   | Result                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–16  | No effect                                                                                                     |
| 17–18 | Shadowfell influence causes nightmares or disturbing visions; regain only half spent Hit Dice                 |
| 19    | Feywild influence grants vivid, exciting dreams or visions; gain inspiration                                  |
| 20    | Earth influence fortifies and strengthens flesh and bones; gain temporary hit points equal to character level |

### Terrain

The Moon Hills are an ideal spot for ambush, as the steep slopes favor a well-planned attack. Bandits and intelligent monsters prefer to open an assault with missile fire from atop a hill. Their targets can either trudge upslope, enduring attacks along the way, or flee along the gullies between the hills. But with the gullies providing a predictable path, smart attackers have more ambushers in place just around the corner. Devious foes might even send a group to cut off retreat back in the ambushed travelers’ original direction.
