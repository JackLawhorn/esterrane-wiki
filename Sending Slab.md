title: The Oakwest Company's Sending Slab Network
---

**Sending Slabs** are forged from raw materials derived from a single stone found in the [[Western Isles]]. With the help of the [[Gondar of Powderkeep Blackmetal]], the [[Oakwest Company]] developed the *Sending Slab Network* which works via an enhanced version of the *Sending* spell.

To crews – especially those that often travel between [[Esterrane]]'s major port cities and face the dangers associated with such voyages – affording a Sending Slab of their own is a significant goal.

When activated, a sending slab could be used to cast a sending spell targeting another slab within range. Alternately, one could communicate with any and every other slab within range.
