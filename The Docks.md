**The Docks** is the common name for the lowest of [[Midmark]]'s three economic districts. The [[Midmark#The Port of Midmark|port]] is the lifeblood of the Docks and the livelihoods of the people who live here: dock workers, fishermen, boat-smiths, and water taxi operators. This body of water defines not only the people, but also the borders between colonial Portsmouth, the bustling [[#The Western Quarter|Western Quarter]], and the residential [[#The Eastern Quarter|Eastern Quarter]]. ^b8ee3a

## Welcome to the Docks

The Docks begin at the island of [[Midmark]]'s northernmost point on either side of the [[Midmark#The Port of Midmark|port]]'s mouth and stretching southward partway up the hill that the rest of the city was built up upon. The architecture here is very urban and densely-packed. The roads are cobble-stone, the buildings are wood or brick with chimneys billowing smoke.

The people here are largely poor but also strong, supportive, and loyal. Most natives live in the more residential [[#Exploring the Eastern Quarter|Eastern Quarter]] and make their way across the channel or up hill in the wee hours of the morning as part of a daily mass commute. The [[#Exploring the Western Quarter|Western Quarter]] where a constant influx of tourists and visitors from throughout [[Esterrane]] means .


There are also bulletin boards every few blocks up and down this street. These are covered in community event fliers, apprentices wanted posters, and bounty notices.

## Sub-districts & Landmarks

### Portsmouth

### The Western Quarter

West of the channel, the Docks are primarily centered around the business brought by inbound ships just arriving in the city of [[Midmark]]. More well-off visitors may tie down in the middle-class [[The Hub|Hub]], but the immigrants, refugees, and wide-eyed tourists find comfort in the innumerable taverns, tchotchke shops, and gambling parlors that the Docks' Western Quarter has to offer.

### The Eastern Quarter

East of the channel, where only the outbound ships already leaving the city of [[Midmark]] pass by, the Docks is almost entirely residential. Natives of the Eastern Quarter primarily work in the [[#Exploring the Western Quarter|Western Quarter]] across the way or in middle-class [[The Hub]] further uphill, and so the streets here are quiet during the day. Outsiders will find less trouble here than in the Western Quarter, but also may not find much for them here apart from odd jobs and lesser-appreciated cultural centers and historical sites.

While the redeveloped Western Quarter scarcely resembles the colonial ghetto of Midmark's past, the East still bears scars for those who know what to look for. The racially-segregated subdistricts that had been enforced by the [[Waris Empire]] prior to the [[Midmark Revolution]] survive today as social and cultural hubs. Those in the know will find exotic ethnic food from far-off regions, master craftsmen, and other hidden gems nestled in the sprawling, sometimes labyrinthine urban environment of the Western Quarter.
