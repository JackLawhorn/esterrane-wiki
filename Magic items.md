## Aerghum Root

As an action, you may chew the Aerghum root – consuming it over the course of an hour. For the next hour, you do not need to breathe as the root produces oxygenated air inside your mouth.

- Something about sharing air
- Touch range
- Bonus action?

> Aerghum mangroves evolved roots that expel a significant amount of oxygen when bitten by creatures that would prey on them.

## Orb of Repel Water

As an action, you may activate the orb or deactivate it if it is already activated. When the orb is activated, all water within 10 ft of it is immediately repelled and – until it is deactivated – water may not enter this radius and will instead flow around the sphere of dry air that is created by this effect.
