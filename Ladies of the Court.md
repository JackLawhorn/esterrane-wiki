**The Ladies of the Court** is an esteemed and exclusive women's [[#Finishing School|finishing school]], social club, and professional network founded by [[Madame Katherine]] – a [[Waris Empire|Waris]] woman of immense wealth whose political connections and back alley deals are largely responsible for holding all of [[Esterrane]] together. Katherine is said to hand select each and every final round applicant herself, and each graduate leaves with impeccable manners and a keen eye for the politics of polite society.

## Madame Katherine

Madame Katherine is the enigmatic founder and matriarch of the Ladies of the Court and one of the most powerful individuals in all of [[Esterrane]]. After arriving in [[Midmark]] in the years following the [[Midmark Revolution|Revolution]], she quickly established a number of high-profile connections around the region which both spanned political divides and blurred legal lines. These connections acted as the foundation for the immense network that the Ladies of the Court leverages today.

Though little is known about Katherine's personal history before arriving in Esterrane, it is known that she hails from the [[Waris Empire|Waris]] capital of [[Bleigh]] and is a daughter of one of its minor houses. The [[#The Ladies of the Court Finishing School|Finishing School]]'s syllabus of instruction takes inspiration from the skills that she learned during her time in the [[Royal Court]].

## The Ladies of the Court Finishing School

Based in [[Midmark]]'s central, business-class district – colloquially known as [[The Hub]] – the Ladies of the Court Finishing School prepares a select cohort of young women for a life of politics and influence. No matter their beginnings, each graduate is sure to find their way into prized and incredibly lucrative professional opportunities through the alumni network's vast web of connections.

Such opportunity is so highly prized that wealthy [[Oakwest Company]] executives and [[Waris Empire|Waris]] loyalists alike will prepare their daughters as best they can, but [[Madame Katherine]] and her aides find equally worthy candidates in the region's lower-class districts – some of them little more than street urchins. The admittance process and Katherine's selection criteria are largely a mystery, but the resulting cohort is comprised of Ladies from a wide variety of backgrounds with those of every class, race, and faith represented.

Students are trained in accordance with a syllabus informed by Katherine's own time in the Waris Empire's [[Royal Court]]. Lessons include instruction in *Annunciation*, *Dance and Song*, *Deportment*, *Etiquette*, and *Poise*. Tutoring in more academic subjects is provided by alumni and guest lecturers as such an education may prove invaluable in the high society conversations the Ladies will find themselves in. 

## Ladies of the Court Social Clubs

The Ladies of the Court sponsor social clubs in all of [[Esterrane]]'s major port cities which serve as meeting places for members of the [[#The Ladies of the Court Finishing School|finishing school]]'s alumni network, highly sought-after event venues for the elite, and festhalls open to a select list of outsiders on a number of holy days throughout the year.

The [[Midmark]] social club shares its halls with the finishing school itself. For students, this proximity to power – and potential tutors or mentors – is one of the many opportunities that makes selection so prized.

The social club in [[Warwood]] was founded in the [[Waris Empire|Waris]] colony's upper-class district of [[Bleightown]], within walking distance of the [[Governor's Mansions|Governor's Mansion]]. Access to the estates of the wealthiest loyalist families and leadership of the now-returned [[Waris Imperial Navy|Imperial Navy]] is paramount, and truth be told the Ladies have little business elsewhere in Warwood.

The newest of the social clubs was founded in the [[government district]] of [[New Mithas]]. The [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotauran]] culture of the bustling frontier city is wildly out of tune with the Ladies' training and calm nature, but new ventures like the [[Western Isles Expansion]] have led to an influx of their members here.

## Ladies of the Court Across Esterrane

Graduates find their way into prized and incredibly lucrative professional opportunities through the network's vast web of connections. Some are placed in positions among Katherine's other enterprises but the greater network has grown past its reliance her – and continues to grow with each new graduate. Today each student has hundreds of potential teachers, tutors, and mentors to call upon for help.

### Faction Advisors, Liaisons, & Negotiators

Their [[#The Ladies of the Court Finishing School|finishing school]] training has uniquely prepared them to navigating the complex political landscape of the region. They offer invaluable insights as advisors to those at the highest levels of the [[Oakwest Company]], [[Warwood]] and the [[Waris Imperial Navy]], and even the brutal political arena of [[New Mithas]] as advisors.

Smaller factions with far less political weight heavily rely on their services as liaisons and negotiators to reach for opportunities that would otherwise be beyond their grasp. When the [[Explorers Society]] mounts an expedition into the treacherous [[Lawless East]], simply having a Lady of the Court serves as a powerful disincentive for attacks from pirates – though [[Goblins of Esterrane|Goblin]] raids may not be so easily avoided. When [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotauran]] expansion in the [[Western Isles]] encroached too close to [[Powderkeep Blackmetal]], the [[Gondar of Powderkeep Blackmetal|Gondar]] commissioned a guild negotiator to put the issue to bed for good.

### High Society Courtesans

Some find themselves in positions of more indirect political influence, and few are more respected than the courtesans embedded in high society of the region. Though some in Esterrane – as elsewhere – may look down on sex workers, *courtisanerie* is set apart as a highly valued service for the courtesan's impressive education, worldliness, and the insights they are known to impart. Leveraging their beauty and the effortless, near-unnatural elegance instilled in them as students, these Ladies find themselves invited to lavish soirees and executive meetings as often as into the private quarters of the elite.

The *bordellos* found in the upper class districts of [[Midmark]], Warwood, and New Mithas are not just pleasure houses but common meeting places for the rich and powerful. Here, one can find companionship – or privacy if they prefer – and may even benefit from the tempered counsel of the Ladies if they are lucky.

### Madame Katherine's Aides

The most prized opportunity amongst the Ladies of the Court is to serve as a personal aide to [[Madame Katherine]] herself, traveling alongside the enigmatic matriarch aboard her vessel – *The Court's Whisper*. Katherine is constantly hopping between each of [[Esterrane]]'s major port and even [[Thieves' Hole]], personally handling only the most high-profile clients and the most delicate of predicaments. As a result, this role requires the utmost discretion even more so than typical Ladies of the Court engagements.

Katherine selects as her aides only the most promising of [[#The Ladies of the Court Finishing School|Finishing School]] graduates or, in exceedingly rare cases, currently enrolled students in possession of some unique potential only she seems equipped to recognize.

## Patron Deities

While not sponsored by any particular church, [[Madame Katherine]] claims [[Gods & Deities#Sharess|Sharess, the Dancing Lady]] as a personal patron. Sharess's portfolio includes charm, beauty, secrets, and night, and some aspects of her church's dogma can be found in the instruction instilled in the students of the [[#The Ladies of the Court Finishing School|Finishing School]]. For those Ladies of the Court who find employ as influential, [[#high society courtesans]], Sharess is a more significant influence. Their bordellos bear her holy symbol – feminine lips adorned in red – which convey pleasure, hedonism, and sensual fulfillment.

The deity – called *Bast* in the *Mulhorandi* faith – is also known as *Mother of Cats*. While the Ladies themselves employ little feline iconography, some [[Esterrane|Esterraneans]] who are frightened of their unnatural charm or hold [[#Rumors & Mysteries|superstitions]] of their ways believe cats to be spies in their employ.

Other deities worshipped by Ladies of the Court include [[Gods & Deities#Milil|Milil, Lord of Song]] – whose portfolio includes eloquence – and [[Gods & Deities#Eilistraee|Eilistraee, Lady of the Dance]] – whose portfolio includes song, beauty, and dance.

## Allies & Enemies

The Ladies of the Court make allies as easily as they breathe air into their lungs. They have contacts everywhere and influence at all levels of every faction. If their advice and the opportunities they are able to realize for their clients make them invaluable political allies, then the intelligence they gather on their clients – a habit instilled in them as part of their [[#The Ladies of the Court Finishing School|Finishing School]] training – makes them too formidable an opponent. 

Few in [[Esterrane]] are in a position to make an enemy out of [[Madame Katherine]] and her Ladies of the Court. Only [[Pirate Lords|Pirate Lord]] [[Sirmir the Inscrutable]] and his [[reactionary party]] dare oppose her out of hatred for the [[Oakwest Company]] and this time of relative peace she helped bring to the region. They would much rather their young [[Independent Republic of Thieves' Hole|Republic]] be at war with the Company, the [[Waris Imperial Navy]], and even the [[Minotaurs of New Mithas|Minotaurs]] of [[New Mithas]].

## Rumors & Mysteries

><div style="text-align: right">– Common ramblings of the superstitious</div>

Long have rumors been spread regarding [[Madame Katherine]], what goes on in the halls of the Ladies of the Court [[#The Ladies of the Court Finishing School|Finishing School]], and the strange notions that so many of its graduates seem to have been introduced to.

With the access and influence they enjoy, that they seem to accumulate as if it were second nature to them, the superstitious envision a grand conspiracy: that the Ladies hide in plain sight – entrenched in [[Esterrane|Esterranean]] society by means of their legitimate business practices – while their true trade is that of secrets and leverage. Moreover, these services are almost an open secret among the elite who are, to a one, indebted to them as a means of maintaining their status.

Stranger still is the association of cats with the Ladies of the Court. Katherine's worship of [[Gods & Deities#Sharess|Sharess, Mother of Cats]] is one obvious source of this superstition, but some say it goes further back still to [[History of the Ladies of the Court#Events Preceding the Ladies of the Court|a string of vigilante crimes]] preceding her arrival in Esterrane by over a decade.
