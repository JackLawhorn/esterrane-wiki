**The Hub** is the common name for [[Midmark]]'s middle- and business-class district. Sitting half-way up the city's striking hill – above the lower-class [[The Docks|Docks]] and below the ultra-wealthy [[The Town|Town]] – this area is the heart of business in Midmark and the seat of power for the ruling [[Oakwest Company]]. ^a3c07a
