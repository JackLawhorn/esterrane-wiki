**Requirement:** Proficient in Wisdom (Medicine)

## Level 1: Ship Medicine

After finishing a Long Rest, create a number of syringes equal to your Medicine modifier (minimum of 1). For each syringe created, you may choose one of the following effects:
- Some sort of healing ability.
- Removes the Charmed or Frightened condition. The effected target is immune to the Charmed and Frightened conditions for 1 hour.

When you create syringes after finishing a Long Rest, all previously created syringes lose their potency.

## Level 2: 

You gain Expertise in Medicine if you do not already have it.

## Level 2: Enhanced Ship Medicine

You gain an additional formulation for the syringes created by the Ship Medicine feat:
- Replicate the effects of a Short (or Long?) rest.

## Level 3: Doctor's Dedication

Something that interacts with the number of damaged or bloodied Crew members (#)
- Possible feature: You may cast a spell of level # without using a spell slot

You may cast a spell this way a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier. You regain all uses of Doctor's Dedication after completing a Long rest.
