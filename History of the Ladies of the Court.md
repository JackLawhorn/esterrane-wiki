## Events Preceding the Ladies of the Court

Early in the second century of [[Waris Colonization]] in [[Esterrane]], violence against sex workers had become a growing problem. In both of the [[Waris Empire|Empire's]] colonies, the official stance of the [[Waris Imperial Navy|navy]] was that these regrettably fatal incidents were the work of the unruly mob of [[extraplanar refugees]] who had flooded into the region in years past. This, in turn, escalated the already simmering aggression from Waris colonists against those refugees still in [[Warwood]] while awaiting transport to the newly founded labor colony of [[Arkaver]]. In the most shameful moment of Warwood's history, this aggression boiled over into a massacre of a tribe of Lizardfolk refugees – now remembered as the [[Warwood Massacre]].

Less than one month later, another violent assault on a Warwood-based sex worker took place but was thwarted by an unidentified third party who left the perpetrator knocked unconscious and restrained. When authorities arrived, they saw that it was one of their fellow naval officers who had initiated the confrontation. Upon further investigation, evidence for several of the previous incidents – including a unique bladed weapon used in the spree murders that had led to the massacre against innocent refugees – was found in the perpetrator's quarters.

So great was the number of thwarted assaults against the sex workers of both Warwood and Arkaver over the next decade that rumors began to circulate of a vigilante outfit patrolling city streets and rooftops by night. Though no concrete evidence of such an outfit was ever found, such crimes have been nearly nonexistent in Esterrane for over a century now.

## Founding of the Ladies of the Court

In the years following the [[Midmark Revolution|Revolution]], a woman of immense wealth arrived in the [[Midmark]] from the [[Waris Empire|Waris]] capital of [[Bleigh]]. Known only as [[Madame Katherine]], she quickly established a number of high-profile connections across [[Esterrane|Sea of Esterrane]] which spanned political divides and blurred legal lines. These relationships brought prosperity to the burgeoning [[Oakwest Company]] and brought a time of peace between the young city and its sister colony of [[Warwood]].

One of Katherine's lower-profile business ventures during this time was the founding of the [[Ladies of the Court]]: a women's finishing school, social club, and professional network. Membership is exclusive and Katherine is said to hand select each final round applicant. The Ladies themselves come from diverse backgrounds, both the daughters of wealthy and the lower class – some of them little more than street urchins.

The finishing school's graduates leave with impeccable manners and a keen eye for the politics of polite society. Some are lucky enough to enter into prized and incredibly lucrative professional opportunities at Katherine's other enterprises or, better still, to be brought on as one of her personal aids.
